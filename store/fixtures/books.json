They pile up like pages in a book.\r\n    Everything goes unpunished. I have to scream.\r\n\r\n    \u2014Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez-Salazar, Memoria de un \u00e1ngel [Exhibition text]\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez-Salazar asked me to write a text to accompany his photo exhibit Rostros de la M\u00fasica (Faces of Music). It was a show of portraits of traditional musicians from different ethnomusical regions in Guatemala. I was already familiar with Daniel and his work, but writing this text allowed me to delve deeper into his oeuvre and get a better grasp of the principles upon which his artistic work is founded. Two features of Daniel's work impressed me: first, his rigor for recording facts and personalities; and second, his commitment to documenting key moments in Guatemala. What I did not mention at the time, something I still find striking, is the dignity that Daniel captured in the persons he photographed. His portraiture bestowed on each musician the dignity that marginalization and oblivion had wrested from them.\r\n\r\nMore than a decade on, I realize that restoring dignity to people whom circumstances have marginalized and forgotten is a primordial concern that drives Daniel's work. I allude not only to his series on traditional musicians but also to his entire work, including what he has achieved in photojournalism. Ever since I have known him, I have appreciated his work intimately and understand his concern for making artistic creation a factor in social change. I find it natural for him, therefore, to shift from art galleries to public spaces and from decorative aesthetics to the truth as his central theme. Although many people observe a certain harshness in Daniel's current work, its beauty endures. His work is charged with the beauty of truth, as Gordon Nary noted when honoring Daniel with the Jonathan Mann Humanitas Award in recognition of the humanity of his work.\r\n\r\nHis eight years as a photojournalist, mostly in the violent 1980s, awakened Daniel's consciousness about the tragedy of war, especially when the victims are civilians and the victimizers those supposed to protect them. The fruit of those years is by no means merely the extensive photographic collection portraying the suffering of Guatemala and Guatemalans. Rather, it is his concrete commitment to reporting the truth about suffering, to demonstrating that pain is not anonymous: it always has a face and a name. Daniel sticks tenaciously to this commitment, converting it into artistic production. Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum was among the first to acknowledge the essence of this craft. \"Thank you,\" the Nobel laureate wrote at the bottom of a portrait Daniel made of her, \"for your friendship and your contribution to the just cause.\" Rigoberta's portrait hangs on the wall of Daniel's studio, a reminder of his ongoing commitment.\r\n\r\nThis commitment and the aesthetic form it takes are what inspired me to put this book together. The book is not a comprehensive compilation of Daniel's work, nor is it meant to be. What it does is follow Daniel through much of his creative trajectory, one spanning two decades, beginning with his photojournalistic output and ending with his public space installations and actions, including the mutilation and fragmentation of reproductions of his work that had been used to represent, once again, the tragedy of war.\r\n\r\nThe book has three main objectives. The first, deeply embedded in Daniel's creative and professional motivation, is to dignify the more than two hundred thousand victims of the armed conflict and to denounce the horrors of war so that they will not happen again. It would be impossible and unfair, Daniel maintains, to forget so much pain and suffering or to aspire to build a new and better country by turning away from the truth. Second, the book seeks to make visible the Guatemalan holocaust and to place it among other world tragedies: Guatemala's conflict, which targeted primarily the poorest and least privileged, received scant attention from the international community. As conflicts elsewhere fill today's headlines, Guatemala's war and its traumatic aftermath seem even less newsworthy, almost invisible. Daniel's installation of his Angel icon reminds us that whether in a Chuj Maya community in Guatemala's remote northwestern highlands or in Hiroshima, the pain of war is universal. And third, the book develops Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum's acknowledgment of an artist who remains true to the \"just cause\" of reconfiguring history, understanding the truth, and so glimpsing the future. For this reason, Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez-Salazar is among the most renowned and influential artists in Guatemalan and Central American photography.\r\n\r\nPoignant, frank, and moving, Daniel's work is often difficult to frame. Four scholars, with four different perspectives, help us to situate Daniel and his work in historical, political, geographical, and artistic contexts. George Lovell, with his characteristic balance between academic rigor and poetic expression, juxtaposes his sightings of Daniel's polyptych Clarification and a panorama of Guatemala based on Eduardo Galeano's epic trilogy Memory of Fire. Miguel Flores Castellanos explores the links between Daniel's current work and early Central American photography, his previous activities as a photojournalist and commercial photographer, and the controversies that charge contemporary photography. From his viewpoint as an analyst of art and politics, Michael Weinstein examines Daniel's series Eros + Thanatos in the context of postmodernity and of a globalized world. Finally, historical memory and the importance of remembering form the basis of Steven Hoelscher's analysis of Daniel's installations in public spaces, set against the backdrop of a postconflict social landscape.\r\n\r\nSo That All Shall Know is perhaps the most emblematic image of all Daniel's work. He was inspired to use this title by Monsignor Juan Gerardi, who had proposed it for the human rights report ultimately entitled Guatemala: Never Again. Depicting an angel who breaks the silence with a shout, So That All Shall Know is a reminder of the commitment shared by Daniel and the murdered bishop: to reveal the truth as an act of liberation.",

This book covers more than 550 woody shrubs and vines found in Florida.\r\n\r\nThis volume \u2014 a companion to The Trees of Florida, also by Gil Nelson \u2014 is the first comprehensive guide to Florida\u2019s native and naturalized woody shrubs and vines. It is organized as an easy-to-use field guide so that even a beginner can learn to identify plants. The line drawings show a combination of typical leaves, fruits, and flowers, and while accurate in detail, capture an overall impression, so helpful when trying to identify a species in the field. The color photos, all taken in Florida, are useful where color is important in identification.\r\n\r\nThis book will also prove useful to landscape architects and weekend gardeners, for in addition to being a field guide, it also offers important tips about using these plants in urban and suburban landscapes.\r\n\r\nWith Over 250 Drawings by R.

But at the scene of the homicide, her fingerprints are\r\neverywhere\u2014on the door, on the curtain, and on the knife used to stab\r\nhim to death. Shocked and bewildered, Laurie is arraigned on a\r\nmurder charge.\r\nKidnapped at the age of four and the victim of two subsequent years of abuse and incarceration, Laurie has developed multiple personalities.\r\nThe host personality, Laurie, is unaware of the others...especially\r\n\"Leona,\" who has written crazed love letters to Allan Grant and has\r\nsecretly entered his home.\r\nLaurie's sister, attorney Sarah Kenyon, takes up her defense and brings\r\nin psychiatrist Justin Donnelly to help Laurie unlock the unbearable\r\nmemories of her lost years. But Laurie's abductor, now a celebrated television evangelist, is still obsessed with her...and determined\r\nto avoid exposure. With a terrifying twist at the climax, Mary Higgins Clark takes us on a\r\nbreathtaking journey into the minds of a tortured young woman\r\ndesperate to retrieve her memories, and the mesmerizing preacher whose unsavory past is only a prelude to his final, gruesome plan for her....",

It is, therefore, a text from the classical age of Roman literature which deals with a topic to whose enduring popular interest any Western daily newspaper will testify. And yet, despite some notable modern exceptions, the infamously harsh verdict of Manilius' most famous twentieth-century editor, A. E. Housman, continues to cast an imposing shadow on the poem, especially for Anglophone readers. 'Forgotten Stars' seeks to lift this shadow once and for all, as it brings together an international contingent of scholars for an interdisciplinary exploration of Manilius at an auspiciously significant time, close to the bimillennial celebration of the poem's composition. The range of perspectives from which Manilius is approached in the present volume is testament both to his complexity as a writer and to the variety of fruitful avenues there are for enquiry. Matters of literary interest, especially generic affiliation and intertextuality, are complemented by approaches which assess the socio-political, philosophical, scientific, and astrological resonance of the poem. Moreover, as a salutary counterbalance to the relative neglect of our author in recent times, the popular reception of the poem, especially in the Renaissance, is also explored\"--Publisher's description, p.

Every time I gave one of the talks, whether at the City College of the City University of New York, where I have taught since 1968, or at some other institution in the United States, Europe, the Caribbean or Afrika, the positive feedback from my audience told me that a crystallization of these ideas in written form would be useful to my people.\r\n\r\nBetween 1969 and 1979 I wrote a series of about twenty-five articles based on the lectures, collectively entitled, \"Black America, Africa and the Black World.\"  The pieces were published in over twenty magazines, journals and newspapers on the Afrikan continent and her Diaspora. \r\n\r\nAs an educator, and as my philosophy evolved, developed, and matured over the years, I gradually became aware that a relevant education for our people was of paramount importance but sadly lacking.  My research and observations demonstrated to me that a PanAfrikan education, i.e., one that takes into account the entire scope of Africentric knowledge, thought and world-view, was the only feasible one.  I began revising, improving and enlarging upon my original ideas in the hope that students, teachers  and parents would find something applicable  to themselves, their students or their children.  This was the basis for compiling the book.",

Focusing on four women\u2014Caroline Bowles, Maria Gowen Brooks, Sara Coleridge and Maria Jane Jewsbury\u2014and the ways in which they were encouraged and advised by, variously, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, this interesting work adds valuably to the study of neglected but significant women poets and their literary relationships.

This comprehensive cookbook presents the culinary styles and ingredients and trends of the whole West Coast. Alaska has amazing seafood, wild salmon, halibut, and black cod. The Northwest native grilling technique of grilling with flavorful wood planks hails from this region.

Furthermore, California also brings forth the Latino influence, one of America\u2019s true indigenous cuisines. It contains 400 recipes that are easy to prepare, authentic, and delicious.",

            "description": "The 1910s was a decade in which theories of socialism, pacifism, and collectivism flowered. Publicists and playwrights from Sidney Webb to George Bernard Shaw expressed not just belief in \u201cutopianism\u201d but a vigorous assault on the existing political and economic order. Less well known is how a group of Tory thinkers laid the foundations of a conservative counter-attack expressed with equal literary and intellectual brilliance. Foremost among them was W. H. Mallock. In The Limits of Pure Democracy he argued that the pseudo-populist leaders of the political party system promise everything but deliver only the end of parties as such. \r\n\r\nFor Mallock, what starts with populism ends in dictatorship. The Russian Revolution was simply the historical outcome of utopian socialist visions that were more dedicated to destroying the present system of things than bringing about a revitalized future. Mallock\u2019s book explains how the modern free market succeeds through competition in increasing output, broadening occupational opportunities, and multiplying the numbers of skilled professionals. In contrast, welfare schemes serve to deepen poverty by spreading wealth so evenly that incentives to work decline and personal savings are eliminated. \r\n\r\nThese arguments have become commonplace today. But at the time they served as an incendiary reminder that class warfare works in both directions. Mallock was a remarkably talented writer who made the case against exaggerated expectations, a nascent welfare system, and mass political parties led by oligarchs. But he also offered a case for increasing a regard for work, advancing the cause of education as a method of entering the modern world, and for retaining a sense of religious codes that define the West. \r\n\r\nMallock\u2019s search for an understanding of popular rule coincided with his appreciation and elucidation of the limitations of the emerging plebiscitarian spirit within democracy. The Limits of Pure Democracy will be of interest to political scientists, intellectual historians, and economists. \r\n\r\nW. H. Mallock was the author of Religion as a Credible Doctrine, The Reconstruction of Belief, The Individualist, The Heart of Life, and A Human Document. \r\n\r\nH. Lee Cheek, Jr. is Chair of the Social and Behavioral Sciences at Brewton-Parker College in Mount Vernon, Georgia. His books include Political Philosophy and Cultural Renewal, Order and Legitimacy, Calhoun and Popular Rule, and Calhoun: Selected Writings and Speeches.",

She should be a campaigner, showing everyone that storytelling isn\u2019t just for teachers and children but for everyone, that the art is more than just entertainment and fun; it\u2019s a way to pass on our culture from generation to generation. She should be performing for audiences large and small all over the state. She should be an author, collecting and making available for publication fresh, new material. And, most of all, she should be a good listener. I know Annette Bruce to be all these things.\u201d \u2014Bob Patterson, artistic director, Gamble Rogers Folk Festival\r\n\r\n\u201cThe grand dame of Florida storytelling has done it again. More Tellable Cracker Tales promises to be another milestone in the cannon of Florida Cracker culture. A true Southern lady who is at once as sweet as a citrus grove in bloom and as feisty as a fire ant, Annette Bruce, through her stories, speaks of a Florida that needs to be remembered\u2014a Florida filled with humor, grit, and graciousness.\u201d \u2014David Matlack, founder and director, 1998\u20131999 Ocala Storytelling Festival\r\n\r\nDrawn from Florida history, folklore, and fiction, this collection of stories tailor-made for telling will entertain, inspire, and astound readers and listeners of all ages.\r\n\r\nDell, crippled since birth, begs his father to let him nurse a broken-legged colt back to health. Against his better judgment, his father agrees. Soon Dell is no longer the little crippled boy whom people pity but the proud owner of Whirlwind, the fastest and finest horse in all of Marion County.\r\n\r\nCracker Jack is up to his old tricks: putting one over on his Yankee schoolteacher; confounding a census taker; and convincing a befuddled farmer that it\u2019s not Saturday but Sunday (and if the preacher finds him working on a Sunday, well, there\u2019ll be you-know-what to pay!).\r\n\r\nSheriff \u201cPogy\u201d Bill Collins used to be the worst lawbreaker in Okeechobee City. Then he promised Judge Hancock that he\u2019d walk the straight and narrow in return for his release from jail. Pogy Bill kept his promise to the judge . . . and then some.\r\n\r\nDuring the Depression, Roy asks Bill, who\u2019s looking for work on Roy\u2019s farm, what he can do. \u201cI can sleep through a storm,\u201d Bill replies. It seems like an odd answer at the time, but eventually Roy wills his entire farm to Bill.\r\n\r\nIn a place called Dogbone, it\u2019s really not that unusual to see a glow-in-the-dark man running naked after a driverless truck with two barking dogs in pursuit. It even made Ed Grady an honest-to-goodness churchgoer.",

Finally they located 45 horse masks, most of them date from the 19th century. All but one were made prior to 1915. Fine examples from the 19th century, still in the possession of proud descendants of their makers, and which have appearings in Indian parades like at Pendleton, OR, or at Calgary, Alberta, are illustrated herein. This survey of the masking tradition, therefore, extends from 1494 to the present day.\r\n\r\nScores of other masks are illustrated by 18th and 19th century indian paintings and drawings on rock, leather, cloth and paper, and by historic photographs. The symbolism and history of masks is thoroughly discussed and annotated. There is an extensive bibliography and index.\r\n\r\nPainting the face or body of a man or a horse is also a kind of masking. Therefore, a chapter on Cheyenne horse painting and its meaning and usage is also part of this volume, written by Winfield Coleman.",

It has responded \r\nto the social demands of the newly emerging state, as well as to escalating globalization, with a vigorously \r\ndeveloping lexicon, enriched by multiple foreign language contacts. In this detailed and rigorous study, the \r\nauthor provides a principled classification of neologisms, their semantic fields and the roles of source languages,\r\nalong with a sociolinguistic study of purists' and ordinary native speakers' attitudes towards lexical enrichment.\r\nHis analysis of the tension between linguistic creativity and the preservation of a distinct language identity \r\ntakes the discussion beyond the case of Israeli, through innovative comparisons with Revolutionized Turkish, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Yiddish, Estonian, Swahili, pidgins and creoles, and other languages. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the third millennium, our world is characterized by worldwide communication and the vast\r\ndistribution of technological and 'talknological' devices. The mobility of the word respects no borders and the extent of that mobility may not be paralleled even in future (less heterogeneous) generations. The study of \r\nthe modes and dynamics of language contact could hardly be more timely.",

Long gone are the days when a chief executive would disappear for weeks with a towel over his head, only to reappear to announce \u2018the answer\u2019 to the organisation.  Modern leadership is about shaping the social process of engagement, strategizing and decision-making so that workers can create immeasurable value.  This book is about what executives can do to transform the thinking of those around them.  It is about the circuitry that lies beneath the change process and the habits and norms that govern business conversations.  For every senior person that ever had a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the boardroom or was horrified to see great minds producing pulp, this is the book for them.  This book will give you exemplary decision-making, quicker organisational change and focussed leadership.",

Speculum, Vol. 53, No. 4. (Oct., 1978), pp. 795799. ''What we know as Islam, the authors claim, was a Jewish messianic movement known, primarily in Syriac (but also reflected in Armenian and Hebrew) sources, as Hagarism, which moved into the Fertile Crescent, was heavily influenced by the Samaritans and by Babylonian Judaism, and at a certain point (presumably at the time of Abd alMalik, ca. 690) shed its Judaicizing identity to become Arab Islam. This first change required the recasting of whatever memories or records existed of the movement\u2019s birth into a more or less coherent form, a process which occupied much of the following century.\r\n\r\n''http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/04/28/d60428020635.htmtitle=Hagarism: The Story of a Book Written by Infidels for Infidels Liaquat Ali Khan}}''The book titled \"Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World,\" questions just about everything Muslims believe as historical truths. It challenges the common belief that the Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a period of 22 years (610-632) in Mecca and Medina. Instead, the book contends that the Quran was composed, possibly in Syria or Iraq, more than fifty years after the Prophet's death, projected back in time, and attributed to the Prophet. '' \r\n\r\nAccording to ''Hagarism'', the Arab conquests and the formation of the caliphate were a peninsular Arab movement inspired by Jewish messianism, which, in alliance with Jews, attempted to reclaim the Promised Land from the Byzantine Empire. The Qur'an would then be the product of 8thcentury edits of various materials drawn from a variety of JudeoChristian and MiddleEastern sources, and Muhammad the herald of Umar \"the redeemer\", a JewJudaic messiah. The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam\u2019s Holy Book, 1998 Ibn Warraq ''A group of scholars influenced by Wansbrough took an even more radical approach; they rejected wholesale the entire Islamic version of early Islamic history. Michael Cook, Patricia Crone, and Martin Hinds writing between 1977 and 1987 regard the whole established version of Islamic history down at least to the time of Abd alMalik (685-705) as a later fabrication, and reconstruct the Arab Conquests and the formation of the Caliphate as a movement of peninsular Arabs who had been inspired by Jewish messianism to try to reclaim the Promised Land. In this interpretation, Islam emerged as an autonomous religion and culture only within the process of a long struggle for identity among the disparate peoples yoked together by the Conquests: Jacobite Syrians, Nestorian Aramaeans in Iraq, Copts, Jews, and (finally) peninsular Arabs.'' \r\n\r\nPart of the subsequent academic controversy surrounding the book springs from the authors' provocative assertion in the preface that ''Hagarism'' was written \"by infidels, for infidels.\" This claim, in tandem with the tone of the book, has led some critics to question the judgment of Crone and Cook.   \r\n\r\n   Synopsis   \r\n\r\n''Hagarism'' begins with the premise that Western worldWestern historical scholarship on the beginnings of Islam should only be based on historical, archaeological and philological data rather than Islamic traditions which it finds to be dogmaticallybased, historically irreconcilable and anachronistic accounts of the community's past, and of no historic value. Thus, relying exclusively on historical, archaeological and philological evidence, the authors attempt to reconstruct and present what they argue is a more historically accurate account of Islam's origins.  In summary:\r\n\r\nVirtually all accounts of the early development of Islam take it as axiomatic that it is possible to elicit at least the outlines of the process from the Islamic sources. It is however wellknown that these sources are not demonstrably early. There is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century, and the tradition which places this rather opaque revelation in its historical context is not attested before the middle of the eighth. The historicity of the Islamic tradition is thus to some degree problematic: while there are no cogent internal grounds for rejecting it, there are equally no cogent external grounds for accepting it. In the circumstances it is not unreasonable to proceed in the usual fashion by presenting a sensibly edited version of the tradition as historical fact. But equally, it makes some sense to regard the tradition as without determinate historical content, and to insist that what purport to be accounts of religious events in the seventh century are utilizable only for the study of religious ideas in the eighth. The Islamic sources provide plenty of scope for the implementation of these different approaches, but offer little that can be used in any decisive way to arbitrate between them. The only way out of the dilemma is thus to step outside the Islamic tradition altogether and start again. P. Crone and M. Cook, ''Hagarism: The Making Of The Islamic World'', 1977, Cambridge University Press, p. 3 \r\n\r\nAccording to the authors, Hagarism was a heretical branch of Judaism followed by the Hagarenes or Arabs in the early part of the 7th century. To the authors, the surviving records of the period describe the followers of Muhammad as Hagarenes, because of the way Muhammad invoked the Jewish  god in order to introduce an alien monotheismmonotheistic faith to the Arabs. He is reported as doing this by claiming biological descent from Abraham through his slave wife Hagar (biblical)Hagar for the Arabs in the same way as the Jews who claimed descent from Abraham through Sarah and thus as their ancestral faith. During this early period the Jews and the Hagarenes united, into a faith the authors loosely describe as JudeoHagarism, in order to recover the holy land from  the Christian Byzantines. In their analysis, the early manuscripts from eye witnesses suggest that Muhammad was the leader of a military expedition to conquer Jerusalem, and that the original Hijra (Islam)hijra actually referred to a journey from northern Arabia to that city. \r\n\r\nAs time went on, the Hagarenes concluded that the adoption of Judaism and MessianismChristian Messianism did not provide them with the unique religious identity that they aspired for. They also feared that leaning on Judaism too much, might result in outright conversion and assimilation. Thus the hagarenes contrived to create a religion of their own and decided to splinter off from their Judaic practices and beliefs. Driven by a quest for theological legitimacy they devised a version  of Abrahamic monotheism, that evolved from a blend of Judaism, Samaritanism and Christianity, which became what is now Islam. The authors propose that Islam was thus born and fashioned from Judaic mythology and symbology, that is; the creation of a sacred scripture similar to the Jewish Torah  (the Qur\u2019an), and a Moses like prophet; along with a sacred city of Mecca modeled on the Jewish holy city of Jerusalem adjacent to a holy mountain.\r\n\r\nWhile the full assertions of the book were controversial, the attempts to deconstruct early Islamic history have made this a groundbreaking and important work on early Islamic history.\r\n\r\n   Sources  \r\n\r\nThe authors document their thesis that Muhammad was preaching a heretical form of Judaism around 634 and was proclaiming the advent of a Jewish Messiah by drawing upon early nonMuslim sources such as the Doctrina Iacobi (AD 634) and others listed in the table below. \r\n\r\n\r\n 634 Doctrina Iacobi\r\n\r\n 650 Fredegar\r\n\r\n 676 The Synod of 676\r\n\r\n 692 Syriac Apocalypse of PseudoEphraem\r\n\r\n 717 The Vision of Enoch the Just\r\n\r\n 636 Fragment on the Arab Conquests\r\n\r\n 655 Pope Martin I\r\n\r\n 680 George of Resh'aina\r\n\r\n 697 AntiJewish Polemicists\r\n\r\n 717 A Monk of Beth Hale and an Arab Notable\r\n\r\n 639 Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem\r\n\r\n 659 Isho'yahb III of Adiabene\r\n\r\n 680 The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai\r\n\r\n 700 Anastasius of Sinai\r\n\r\n 720 Greek Interpolation of the Syriac Apocalypse of PseudoMethodius\r\n\r\n 640 Thomas the Presbyter\r\n\r\n 660 Sebeos, Bishop of the Bagratunis\r\n\r\n 680 Bundahishn\r\n\r\n 700 Hnanisho' the Exegete\r\n\r\n 720 Willibald\r\n\r\n 640 Homily on the Child Saints of Babylon\r\n\r\n 660 A Chronicler of Khuzistan\r\n\r\n 681 Trophies of Damascus\r\n\r\n 705 Ad Annum 705\r\n\r\n 730 Patriarch Germanos I of ConstantinoplePatriarch Germanus\r\n\r\n 640 John of Nikiu\r\n\r\n 662 Maximus the Confessor\r\n\r\n 687 Athanasius of Balad, Patriarch of Antioch\r\n\r\n 708 Jacob of Edessa\r\n\r\n 730 John of Damascus\r\n\r\n 644 Coptic Apocalypse of PseudoShenute\r\n\r\n 665 Pope Benjamin of AlexandriaBenjamin I\r\n 687 John bar Penkaye\r\n\r\n 715 Coptic Apocalpyse of PseudoAthanasius\r\n\r\n 770 A Maronite Chronicler\r\n\r\n 648 Life of Gabriel of Qartmin\r\n\r\n 670 Arculf, a Pilgrim\r\n\r\n 690 Syriac Apocalypse of PseudoMethodius\r\n\r\n 717 Greek Daniel,First Vision\r\n\r\n 780 Isho'bokht, Metropolitan of Fars\r\n\r\n 785 Stephen of Alexandria\r\n\r\n 785 Theophilus of Edessa\r\n 801 T'ung tien\r\n\r\n \r\n  Impact  \r\nHagarism is widely cited by many modern historians of early Islam, including Bernard Lewis, Bernard Lewis, ''The Jews of Islam'', Princeton University Press, p.203,p. 231  Robert G.

A component-based and object-oriented software engineering needs an approach involving abstraction, specification, and object-oriented design. The approach,  which shows how to decompose a programming problem into parts and then how to build a desired program from independent modules, is critical for larger programs worked on by teams. The book illustrates particular techniques with implementations in Java (a brief introduction to Java is included for those not already familiar with the language). Beginning with smaller programs, to make sure the basic methodology is understood, the book then shows how to apply the same techniques for high-quality programming-in-the-large. (Publisher's copy)",

            "description": "Michael Cavendish has written a book that is a must read for all Florida lawyers and an insightful window into the philosophies of the Florida legal system for nonlawyers. For lawyers, Orange Blossom Jurisprudence offers useful law and useful ideas for law practices. For nonlawyer participants in Florida courts and concerned Florida citizens alike, Orange Blossom Jurisprudence is a quick and interesting read that explains unseen aspects of the Florida legal system.\r\n\r\nOrange Blossom Jurisprudence is a collection of five essays that provide insightful guidance on topics unique to Florida. The first essay explores the roots and essence of Florida common law, the lex non scripta, or uncodified law, written by the Florida Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIn the second essay Cavendish looks into the role and function of the Florida district courts of appeal and describes their \"diagonal authority\" over trial courts situated outside of their geographic limits. Writing as practicing lawyers, we suggest that the practical usefulness of the information conveyed in this section of the book alone makes Orange Blossom Jurisprudence well worth its cover price.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth essays are narrower in focus, offering examples of the creation of two divergent portions of Florida common law. First up is the timely and ever-evolving matter of the law covering intentional misrepresentation claims arising from residential real estate sales. This essay, originally written prior to the advent of the widespread financial troubles now seen in the Florida real estate market will be picked over by real property buyers and sellers alike as they consider their litigation options. The fourth essay revisits the birth and development within Florida common law of the law of claims for spoliation of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe final essay addresses a hitherto obscure Florida Supreme Court opinion from the Civil War era that addressed slavery. Cavendish treats the opinion as Florida's own Dred Scott, and does not mince his words, labeling it the \"worst judicial opinion ever written in Florida,\" but simultaneously advances compelling arguments for widespread study of the opinion as an \"anticanon.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief lesson drawn from the book is that Florida law is especially rich and unique but in need of more attention and study. Any Floridian or lawyer who reads Orange Blossom Jurisprudence is likely to agree, as they enjoy the essays.\r\n\r\nOrange Blossom Jurisprudence is published by Dragon Publishing and sells for $11.50. It is available at major online booksellers.\r\n\r\nJ. Carter Andersen and Shane Ramsey practice with Bush Ross, P.A., in Tampa. Mr. Andersen is a shareholder in the commercial litigation and dispute resolution practice group. Mr. Ramsey is an associate in the bankruptcy and creditors' rights practice group.",

In fear of losing his mind he opens his heart to his friend and love Shasta Garland, who is writing a new novel in her on-going detective series, one that will apply the theme of magic. She supports him in the healing process, and her nurturing strengthens his resolve to attain his mystical aspirations by producing a magical presentation of alchemy: The Alchemical Light Show.

In 1939, seventeen-year-old Austrians Jacob Silverman and Rachael Goldberg were bright, talented, dazzlingly happy and deeply in love.  But, because they were Jews, their families lost everything.  The Nazis took away their jobs, their houses and apartments, their possessions and their money.  They lost contact with loved ones.  Finally, they lost their liberty.  Jacob and Rachael \"grew up\" during the Holocaust.  As teenagers, they survived the beatings, rapes, and murderous acts of the Nazis, enjoyed the physical and spiritual pleasure of being in love and were able to become husband and wife in the Theresienstadt camp.  They escaped, joined the partisans and fought the Nazi enemy, before Jacob and his father were imprisoned in Auschwitz.",

Why should the corpse of a suicide - for that is what it was - have earned this unusual treatment?   In this second volume of Alexander Murray's  'Suicide in the Middle Ages', the author explores the origin of the condemnation of suicide.  The  quest leads along the byways of medieval theology, law, mythology, and folklore - indeed, in some instances far beyond them.  At an epoch when there might be plenty of ostensible reasons for not wanting to live, the ways used to block the suicidal escape route give a unique perspective on medieval religion.",

Truman is more than a rare, intimate, and surprising portrait of a famous First Lady, it is also the heartwarming story of an enduing love and a remarkable political partnership. Margaret Truman has been able to draw on her own personal reminiscences and a treasure trove of 1,000 letters from Bess and several hundred from Harry, never before published.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Margaret Truman reveals the strong role her mother played in harry Truman's important political decisions -- during his ascent to the Senate, the Vice-Presidency, and to the White House itself. And we see history from the inside out as the lives of Harry and Bess evoke the great events of the Truman era: dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the stunning upset of Thomas Dewey, the firing of Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War, the vicious McCarthy hearings, and more. Bess W. Truman recreates the human drama of an extraordinary woman and a man who became a beloved American president.",

The tools used vary according to the situation but they are all rigorous, systematic and depend to a greater or lesser extent on the knowledge of team members. This book provides a selection guide that introduces, describes and illustrates the most commonly used techniques, and then directs the reader to more detailed references where fuller guidance may be found on the specific technique. It is not intended to provide a full listing of all of the available techniques. The selection is based on an analysis of the more common techniques used by European Process Safety Centre (EPSC) members. It should be noted that the authors found that a general technique might have some very small, industry specific, features or changes and then be known by a different name. The descriptions given here for each technique are generic and nonindustry specific, so that the techniques can be used by different industries with minor, case specific variations. In the descriptions it will be seen that a technique may sometimes use an adapted part of another technique. This too is to be expected as most methods will include the best parts of other, tried and tested techniques. The techniques selected by EPSC include some that are on the boundary between identification and assessment. These include: ( fault tree analysis (FTA); ( event tree analysis (ETA); ( failure modes effects (and criticality) analysis (FME(C)A). These techniques can be used both analytically and quantitatively. In the first mode they can be used as an investigative tool but it is in the second mode that they have most use.\r\n\r\nEach technique is described under the following headings: ( definition; ( description; ( resource requirements (both personnel and documentation); ( timing (against the process hazard analysis (PHA) time frame); ( advantages, disadvantages and uncertainties; ( applications; ( illustrated example (if needed).The timing of use is not always critical (other than possibly for HAZOP (hazard and operability) study) and is given against the main stages of the development of a `project`. It is recognized that a `project` could be a maintenance task, a modification or a large construction project. The techniques can be of value in any task; the only differences will be in the depth, effort and recording. The examples given are deliberately simple, require little or no specific prior knowledge and therefore can be easily understood. Full, real examples would be much more complex and detailed and cannot be used in an introductory text such as this. The appendices take the reader through three examples and show which of the tools and when they may be most appropriate for those particular examples. The examples then give a brief example of use in the development. The worked examples in the text give more detailed guidance.",

Focusing on the town of Morvedre in the kingdom of Valencia, Mark Meyerson shows how and why Morvedre's Jewish community revived and flourished in the wake of the horrible violence of 1291. Drawing on a wide array of archival documentation, including Spanish Inquisition records, he argues that Morvedre saw a Jewish \"renaissance.\"\r\n\r\nMeyerson shows how the favorable policies of kings and of town government yielded the Jewish community's demographic expansion and prosperity. Of crucial importance were new measures that ceased the oppressive taxation of hte Jews and minimized their role as moneylenders. The results included a reversal of the credit relationship between Jews and Christians, a marked amelioration of Christian attitudes toward Jews, and greater economic diversification on the part of Jews.\r\n\r\nRepresenting a major contribution to debates over the Inquisition's origins and the expulsion of the Jews, the book also offers the first extended analysis of Jewish-converso relations at the local level, showing that Morvedre's Jews expressed their piety by assisting Valencia's conversos. Comparing Valencia with other regions of Spain and with the city-states of Renaissance Italy, it makes clear why this kingdom and the town of Morvedre were so ripe for a Jewish revival in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n--From book jacket.",

Contrary to stereotype, what Adler discovered was neither cults nor odd sects, but religious groups that are nonauthoritarian in spirit and share the belief that there is no one single path to divinity.\r\n\r\nThis fully revised edition of Drawing Down the Moon has been expanded to include an updated resource guide of newsletters, journals, books, groups, and festivals.",

            "description": "Modern accounts of how the classical Romans sued each other tend to show the opponents willingly working together under the guidance of a magistrate, until their case was ready for trial. The parties found a convenient time to make their first appearance, at which time they decided on the details of their case, selected a judge, and received permission to go to trial. If any delay were necessary, the magistrate helped the parties in their arrangements to return.\r\n\r\nThis picture is unrealistic: it presumes a high degree of cooperation between the parties, the personal stewardship of a magistrate, and the ready availability of a judge. This accepted picture emerged over time from a tiny amount of evidence. Justinian had no interest in preserving evidence on classical procedure, and subsequent generations of jurists often did not regard rules of procedure as worthy of interest.\r\n\r\nRecent years, however, have brought a flood of new evidence on classical Roman legal procedure. Metzger examines this evidence, painting a picture of litigation that is far less polite and far less orderly. He examines how the rules of procedure coped with the typical pretrial delays that the Roman system, and indeed any legal system, faces.",

Assembling plates correctly and with precision requires great skill while resolving and troubleshooting problems such as distortion as they arise requires know how and experience. This book will provide both actual and aspiring welder fitters with the skill and experience to jump to the head of the class. \r\nThe Welder Fitter's Training Guide begins with the basic elements of the plate fitting trade. The early lessons, which include practice projects, illustrate the working tools and the numerous conditions in which they can be used. \r\nSubjects are designed to be progressive so that each step adds to the experience gained from the preceeding lesson. The student's progress is nurtured, along with the actual work projects which are followed with appropriate questions and answers, to make sure that the skills are fully absorbed. \r\nAfter learning the marking and aligning techniques at the beginning of the book the student is introduced to fabricating small and simple weldments. Material lists are provided to facilitate the projects. Gradually the fabrications become a little more complicated but because of the numerous illustrations and the simple methods of presentation the lessons are easily learned. \r\nMost blueprint reading textbooks teach the basis of reading a drawing. The Welder Fitter's Training Guide goes far beyond that by teaching how to work from a drawing, how to begin the job, how to avoid misalignment and weld distortion, and work to close tolerances, how to work with product planners and draftsmen, how to reinforce for maximum control against warpage, how to foresee potential problems before they arise and much more. \r\nWith this book the student can be fitting weldments in just a few weeks. \r\n\r\nReference: Stewart, John P., Welder/Fitter's Training guide, 170 pages, 1994, ISBN 0-9692845-4-3.",

A few years later, he was bellhopping at a hotel in Fort Worth, where he supplemented his income peddling bootleg out of the package room. He shuddered out the DTs as a watchman on a West Texas oil pipeline. He outraged teachers, cheated mobsters, and almost got himself beaten to death by a homicidal sheriff's deputy. And somewhere along the way, Thompson became one of the greatest crime writers America has ever known.\r\n\r\nIn this uproarious autobiographical tale, the author of After Dark, My Sweet and Pop. 1280 tells the story of his chaotic coming of age and reveals just where he acquired his encyclopedic knowledge of human misbehavior. Bad Boy is a bawdy, brawling book of reprobates--and an unfettered portrait of a writer growing up in the Southwest of the Roaring Twenties.",

Their battle to survive is filled with harsh difficulties in this wild and fickle new home, and they all work long, hard days. Solomon\u2019s father, Moses, dreams of his only son sharing his love for the land. Lela, his mother, tries to shield Solomon from his father\u2019s expectations, for she knows that the boy\u2019s heart is not in the fields.\r\n\r\nSolomon is a natural woodsman, good at fishing and hunting. Though these skills bring food to their meager table, Moses wants his son to concentrate on farming. Further distancing father and son is the arrival of a refined Virginian brandishing a fifteen-foot whip with deadly precision. Solomon is captivated by the man and the whip while Moses despises the whip and dreads his son\u2019s fascination with the newcomer. Lela struggles to make a home, keep peace between her husband and son, and continue Solomon\u2019s education as they fight to survive.\r\n\r\nWhen the chance comes to go on a cattle drive, Solomon jumps at it\u2014though his parents are reluctant to let him go. He confronts a new world as he rides a Florida marshtackie horse, wields his whip rounding up a large herd of wild cattle, and brings them to market at the coast\u2014where he sees sights he had never dreamed existed.\r\n\r\nAre the Freemans strong enough to build a successful homestead? Will they be welcomed in this hard place where blacks have only been slaves in years past? Will the family seal its bond through shared hardship or splinter irreparably? Does Solomon have the wisdom he needs to face challenges beyond his years and see the family through its perils?",

Not Without My Daughter is the true story of one woman's desperate struggle to survive and to escape with her daughter from an alien and frightening culture. \r\n\r\nBetty had married the Americanized Dr. Sayed Bozorg Mahmoody in 1977. His interest in his homeland had been revived since Khomeini's takeover, and he had increasingly expressed his desire to introduce his five-year-old daughter Mahtob and his American wife to his beloved family in Tehran.\r\n\r\nBetty and her daughter anxiously awaited the end of their vacation in this hostile land, but the end never came--Moody had other plans for his family. Betty and Mahtob became virtual hostages of Betty's tyrannical husband and his often vicious family.\r\n\r\nHiding her secret meetings from her husband and his large network of spies, a desperate Betty began to plan her escape. But every option involved leaving Mahtob behind, abandoning her to Moody and a life of near-slavery and degradation.\r\n\r\n...\r\n(front flap)",

            "description": "Over the past six decades, Burt Bacharach's songwriting has touched millions of listeners all over the world. Here, Bacharach steps out from behind the music to give an honest, engaging look at his life--from his work with Hal David, Dionne Warwick, Elvis Costello and many others, to his tumultuous marriages and the devastating fate of his beloved daughter. Growing up in Forest Hills, NY, during the 1930s and 1940s, Bacharach fell in love with music after sneaking into a Manhattan club to see the legendary Dizzy Gillespie. After a stint in the Korean War, he toured the world with Marlene Dietrich, wrote an endless string of hits, scored numerous Hollywood films, married movie star Angie Dickinson, and composed the music for the Broadway hit Promises, Promises. While he soared professionally, Bacharach's private life was dominated by the never-ending search for love--and the heartbreak that comes when it is lost--which is reflected in his greatest songs.--From publisher description.",

Sophie Coe begins with the basic foodstuffs, including maize, potatoes, beans, peanuts, squash, avocados, tomatoes, chocolate, and chiles, and explores their early history and domestication. She then describes how these foods were prepared, served, and preserved, giving many insights into the cultural and ritual practices that surrounded eating in these cultures. Coe also points out the similarities and differences among the three cuisines and compares them to Spanish cooking of the period, which, as she usefully reminds us, would seem as foreign to our tastes as the American foods seemed to theirs. Written in easily digested prose, America's First Cuisines will appeal to food enthusiasts as well as scholars.",

            "description": "Wisdom the Sense of Enlightenment, was created through the meditation and contemplative writing that was done through the inspiration of the prayers I said before I wrote. I reflected on my life and wrote according to the lessons I learnt, from being a follower of Jesus Christ. Although I was facing tribulations in my personal life, at the time of creating the book, I held to my belief in faith that the challenges would be overcome. With my life dedicated to the working for god, I feel as though I have a responsibility of the written material, that I present. It is said in the Bible, to speak the truth of god in the ministering of his wisdom, or face the consequences for those who lead people astray. So, I hold true to the work I write. The book was in development for 2 years, and the total poetry pieces I had completed, were in the area of 250. I selected the latest work, and they became the book. I dedicated the work to my family, and to those who search for healing. As, I too, had been deep in turmoil and by the grace of god, I believe I was saved and restored, with more strength to continue in my life\u2019s journey, with god as my source of peace. To read the book is a sobering experience, from the troubles that can follow a person around, and it also is a book of insight, and reminds even me the author, of the hope in gods' guidance and direction of his awesome will. It is a comforting experience to read the book that stimulates the mind and senses of the body. Also, Wisdom the Sense of Enlightenment, once read is a connection to the enlightened state that perceives the spiritual world. The wisdom within the book, lastly, is my contribution for the inquiring souls, who are in need to be filled with gods\u2019 message through me.",

Flush distracted Elizabeth Barrett after her favorite brother's death. Formidable, eccentric Emily Bronte, who once savagely beat her fierce mastiff, Keeper, for sleeping on her bed, refused to sentimentalize the human-dog bond in Wuthering Heights. Carlo, a Newfoundland, comforted Emily Dickinson in a dark time--when she may have been in love with a married man--and Edith Wharton mourned the death of one of her pooches more than the death of her mother. And Adams suggests that Virginia Woolf, depicting a dog's trauma in her biography of Flush, who was dognapped for ransom, dealt with her own childhood molestation. Lovers of both dogs and classic writers will identify with this sweet, quirky book.--From publisher description.",

They were in a hurry to reach the safety of their home before nightfall. Suddenly, the crowded street they were on became eerily quiet. And then, out of nowhere came an explosion of bullets and shrapnel . . .\r\n\r\nWithin hours their tragedy was all over the news. But who was this couple?

The book is divided into sections on drinks, appetizers, salads, soups, sandwiches, entr\u00e9es, sides, breakfast specialties, sweet things, and condiments, making it easy to find your favorites in no time. And the recipes yield out-of-this-world results.

The author even presents a technique (not recommended) for obtaining quills from live porcupines; she, of course, explores more conventional ways as well. A good explanation of the necessary tools follows with photographs. Her chapter on General Work Instructions and Basic Stitches is designed to help the reader understand the basic steps upon which the more difficult techniques are built. She is liberal with her advice in keeping things simpleand divulges many of the secrets she has discovered over the past eighteen years. With William C. Orchard (Heye Foundation, 1917), as a starting point, she has examined numerous museum pieces in her search for the proper techniques.\r\n\r\nThe reader is encouraged to master the techniques in the Basic Quilling Techniques Chapter and the book is designed so that each step builds upon the next. Of general interest are the diverse techniques that Native Americans used (use) to create rosettes. The book also includes a fine explanation of the steps used to make brain tanned rawhide and leather, and has a much needed disclosure of how to prepare and use natural dyes on quills. Advanced techniques are explained in text, illustrations and photographs. \r\n\r\nThis exciting book of ninety-two pages contains 53 black and white photographs, 4 full pages in four color, 39 figures, 2 tables and 115 illustrations. A text that should be of interest to anyone who enjoys traditional arts and crafts, the culture of the American Indian and the early lifestyle of Native Americans. It may well be the new definitive source of this beautiful art form.",

The Souls of the Skyscraper documents and explains the transformation of clerical work from a male to a female occupation amidst the industrialization and urbanization of the United States. Using literary, organizational, statistical, cinematic, and archival evidence primarily from Chicago, Lisa M. Fine explains the historical reasons why clerical work became women's work.\r\n\r\nThe author also explores the realms where the gender definition of clerical work was discussed, debated, and negotiated: among technical experts, in the popular culture, in the prescriptions and actions of civic leaders, and in the private worlds of clerical workers themselves. She reveals the dynamics of change within the clerical sector and provides us with the fullest explanation for why this gender shift occurred. By emphasizing the active role of women in choosing clerical work, this study adds a new dimension to our understanding of occupational sex-typing.",

Mina soon became his second wife, and Fort Myers\u2014a remote, almost inaccessible, village on Florida\u2019s southwest coast\u2014became their winter home.\r\n\r\nOther tomes tell the global account of Thomas Edison, the American icon named by Life magazine as the \u201cMan of the Millennium.\u201d This book offers a look at his life in his tropical retreat, his \u201cjungle,\u201d where for forty-six years he and his bride sought refuge from the cold winters and the demanding lifestyle of his New Jersey home, laboratory, and business complex.\r\n\r\nWhile in Fort Myers he watched over his extensive botanical gardens, fished from both his boat and his long dock, interacted with the locals, and labored for many hours in his laboratory. Henry Ford and his family lived next door and many dignitaries came to visit, including President-elect Hoover and Harvey Firestone.\r\n\r\nThe Edisons became an essential part of the Fort Myers story. They made lifelong friendships with townsfolk and joined in local activities until the love affair of the Edisons was cut short by the death of Thomas in 1931. Mina continued to live out her love for Fort Myers and its people until her death in 1947. She gave their winter estate, Seminole Lodge (Thomas\u2019s \u201cjungle\u201d), to the grateful citizens of Fort Myers.",

As the world heads for food shortages in the next century insects can help meet humanity's growing nutritional needs.\r\nCreepy Crawly Cuisine tells you everything you need to know to make insects a part of your diet. It includes an overview of the use of edible insects by indigenous cultures, information on where to obtain insects and how to store and prepare them, and over 60 gourmet recipes, complete with stunning color photographs, that let you take the cooking of insects to dazzling culinary heights.",

Her story is told through her memories of her early life; her journal; her \"birthday book,\" in which she made annual entries from 1873 to 1905; selected letters; and Maria Ellsworth's own interpretive material. Born in 1858, Ida Hunt Udall began her Mormon odyssey when she was quite young, pioneering with her family in Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. With the coming of the anti-Mormon crusade focusing on polygamists, Ida was forced to go into hiding soon after her marriage in 1882. She vividly describes her marriage, her life on the \"underground\" and the prison experiences of her husband as reported to her in letters she copied into her journal.\r\n\r\nMaria Ellsworth, Ida's granddaughter, weaves these materials into a compelling tale of hard work, courage, sacrifice, and devotion to a family, a religion, and a cause that defined her being and gave meaning to her life. She includes details of Ida's life based on the journals of Ida's sisters, family recollections, and historical documents. Mormon Odyssey provides a \"window\" on polygamy, with all its conflicts and disappointments, as well as its rewards.",

Like deja vu, it apparent to him that we are facing situations that seem strangely similar if not precisely the same as nearly forty years ago.  \r\n\r\nPresident Barak Obama could easily step into the same quicksand, because that is metaphorically what it is, if he is not careful.  C. J. Jung might see our new president as the archetypical leader destined to return the United States to the citadel on the hill.  He certainly has his work cut out for him.  \r\n\r\nConsider this: for far too long the US Congress has stayed the same, has missed the changes, hasn't had the fortitude to face them, and consequently, it has left the future up for grabs.  \r\n\r\nA LOOK BACK TO SEE AHEAD asks the reader to see how little has changed, and why attempting to solve our problems with the same thinking that created them can no longer be tolerated.  Dr. Fisher describes the problem.  He feels there is no shortage of experts who would provide the prescription, hopefully, with the caveat he offers here.",

            "description": "Edited by Yana Mintoff Bland\r\nAddresses from the Association of Women of the Mediterranean Region, 1996 Conference\r\n\r\n -excerpted from the introduction\r\n\"During the cold war, it seemed that antagonistic systems were responsible for perpetuating the arms race, encouraging dictatorships, and increasing poverty in the Mediterranean--and indeed the world as a whole. But, post-cold war years have dispersed this smokescreen. Essentially it is the monopolization and militarization of natural resources and capital that now reveals its violent, patriarchal, impoverishing face; and its grimace is reflected in the perpetual frown of the woman refugee.\r\n\r\nThe militarists and the monopoly capitalists go on blaming the victims! They call us Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots; Bosnian Serbs, Bosnians and Bosnian Croats; they call us Jordanian Palestinians and Lebanese Palestinians, or they ignore us; they call us subversives or treat us as pliable pawns; they separate us from the sea that unites us, and they destroy that sea; they sell arms, and drugs, and prostitute our women, and they relentlessly exploit and afterwards ignore the poverty their greed perpetuates.\r\n\r\nWe ask you not to ignore the reality of present-day capitalism, led by ruthless multi-national syndicates and corrupted governments. We ask you to listen to the stories of the refugees and immigrants whose lives are being shattered, and whose fragmented societies make up the mosaic of the Mediterranean today. . . \"\r\n\r\n\"This book is a valuable contribution to the understanding of Mediterranean Women.\"\r\nProfessor Elizabeth Fernea, Author, Middle East Studies, University of Texas, Austin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Handsomely produced and iminently readable, this collection is a must for anyone wishing to familiarize themselves with refugee situations, the plight of women in the area, and/or the politics of the region. The women's voices are so welcome an antidote to the barbarism being promoted by the New World (Dis)Order. The expressions of their longing for peace and justice are cries which we cannot afford to ignore.\"\r\nHusayn Al-Kurdi, Editor, News International Press Service, San Diego, CA\r\n\r\n\"A testament to the coalition-building efforts of the Association of Women of the Mediterranean Region, this collection is filled with important insights into the role gender plays in the lives of refugees and immigrants in the Mediterranean countries. The contributors bring to their articles a host of frontline experiences. Their work in camps and with aid organizations facilitates acute analyses of empowerment and agency among women who have been uprooted--in one way or another--from their cultural heritage. 'Nobody Can Imagine Our Longing' is a thoughtful and accessible chronicle of the myriad struggles of a group of women whose experiences until now have gone largely unexamined.\"\r\nProfessor Angela Davis, Activist, Teacher, Author, University of California, Santa Cruz",

As humans encroach on their habitat, gopher tortoises find themselves in a desperate struggle for territory and food, indeed for the very survival of their species.\r\n\r\nAnd survive they must. The survival of so many other species depends on them. The burrow of a gopher tortoise provides shelter (and sometimes food) to about 400 other species. Within these dark tunnels made and maintained by the gopher tortoise, species have been found that live nowhere else on earth. And it\u2019s not an overstatement to say that the human species depends on the health of the gopher tortoise and its entire natural community.\r\n\r\nThis book will appeal to all ages, from 10 up. The hundreds of color photos and easy text will appeal to children and to students seeking details not readily available elsewhere. Adults too will find this book provides a detailed and first-rate explanation of the critical role this fascinating tortoise plays in shaping the upland environs of Florida and the Southeast. Individuals and families who enjoy outdoors activities will find this book a virtual guide to many of the plants and animals they see in these areas.",

Local people believe that the ghostly animal is carrying out the curse of Dirk Valentine, the romantic outlaw who was killed many years ago at Shadow Ranch, where he had gone to fulfill a promise to his sweetheart. Suspecting that a treasure hidden by Valentine may be at the root of the Shadow Ranch mystery, Nancy undertakes a challenging search, aided by her friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne. The first vital clue is found in an antique watch and sparks a series of clever deductions and dangerous developments. While seeking further clues, the girls' investigation in a ghost town ends in near disaster when Nancy is trapped inside a building that is toppled by a rockslide -- a rockslide which is deliberately caused. But the pretty titian-haired detective remains undaunted in her determination to solve the mystery.",

'Micmac Quillwork', the first major work on this art form, falls naturally into three sections. \r\n\r\nThe opening chapters are a comprehensive history of the craft, from the period of European contact to the present, tracing the use of quill weaving, embroidery, plaiting, wrapping, and the rise of the technique known as bark-insertion. As bark-insertion was the only type of quillwork to survive into the 19th and 20th centuries, the book's main emphasis is on this variation. \r\n\r\nSection Two covers materials, construction and ornamentation techniques, with Section Three an exhaustive record of quillwork designs. Comparisons are made to similar motifs in other Micmac media. \r\n\r\nAn appendix discusses known quillwork artists; another deals with the conservation of quillwork. \r\nThere is an extensive bibliography.\" - from the dust jacket.\r\nIncludes over 500 b&w illustrations/pictures (and 32 colour pictures) of quillwork items of the Micmac people.",

            "description": "One moment Helen was the petted eldest child of wealthy, privileged parents, disciplined and coddled by servants, dressed in silk for \"best\" and prim private school uniforms for \"everyday.\" the next, she was the unpaid, half-starved housekeeper for an unemployed clerk and his harridan wife--her father and mother.\r\n\r\nHere she tells the story of her desperate girlhood during that grim period known as the Depression. At twelve, she was plunged overnight into the most appaling poverty, plumped down in the noisome slums of South Liverpool, and forced by circumstance to be nursemaid to her youngest brother and sister, and cook-housekeeper for her sick and frantic parents. It was accepted that Helen, the oldest, would grow up to be the old-maid sister, uneducated and unskilled, forever in service to the family.\r\n\r\nHow she rebelled and won her way, step by aching step, to a life of her own is the theme of this powerful autobiography. In the course of relating her own struggles and setbacks, she gives a piercingly frank picture of privation at its most grim, seen--as few writers have been able to see it--from within and in contrast to the earlier life she had led.\r\n\r\nThe title of the book is derived from the fact that Minerva is the patron goddess of Liverpool, the city in which Helen found herself to be the archetypical stepchild. Many years later, from the perspective of 5,000 miles away, she felt compelled to write the story of those terrible years; which culminated in the resolution of the war within her family, and her personal achievement of a place in the sun.",

            "publish_date": "February 23, 2000",
            "description": "From the Inside Flap:\r\n\r\nThis is a coder's book. It's intended to help developers build applications that make use of Transact-SQL. It's not about database administration or design. It's not about end-user or GUI application development. It's not even about server or database performance tuning. It's about developing the best Transact-SQL code possible, regardless of the application.\r\n\r\nWhen I began writing this book, I had these design goals in mind:\r\n\r\nBe very generous with code samples--don't just tell readers how to do something, show them. Include complete code samples within the chapter texts so that the book can be read through without requiring a computer or CD-ROM. Use modern coding techniques, with specific emphases on ANSI compliance and current version features and enhancements. Construct chapters so that they're self-contained--so that they rely as little as possible on objects created in other chapters. Provide real-world code samples that have intrinsic value apart from the book. Avoid rehashing what's already covered extensively in the SQL Server Books Online. Highlight aspects of Transact-SQL that differentiate it from other SQL dialects; don't just write another ANSI SQL book. Avoid excessive screenshots and other types of filler mechanisms often seen in computer books. Proceed from the simple to the complex within each chapter and throughout the book. Provide an easygoing, relaxed commentary with a de-emphasis on formality. Be the reader's indulgent, amiable tutor. Attempt to communicate in writing the way that people speak.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to judge for yourself whether these goals have been met, but my hope is that, regardless of the degree of success, the effort will at least be evident. About the Sample Databases\r\n\r\nThis book uses SQL Server's Northwind and pubs sample databases extensively. You'll nearly always be able to determine which database a particular example uses from the surrounding commentary or from the code itself. The pubs database is used more often than Northwind, so, when it's not otherwise specified or when in doubt, use pubs.\r\n\r\nUsually, modifications to these databases are made within transactions so that they can be reversed; however, for safety's sake, you should probably drop and recreate them after each chapter in which they're modified. The scripts to rebuild them (instnwnd.sql and instpubs.sql) can be found in the \\Install subdirectory under the root SQL Server folder. Results Abridged\r\n\r\nIf I have a pet peeve about computer books, it's the shameless use of space-filling devices to lengthen them--the dirty little secret of the computer publishing industry. Many technical books these days overflow with gratuitous helpings of screenshots, charts, diagrams, outlines, sidebars, icons, line art, etc. There are people who assign more value to a book that's heavy, and many authors and publishers have been all too happy to accommodate them. They seem to take the old saying that \"a picture is worth a thousand words\" literally--in some cases turning out books that are little more than picture books.\r\n\r\nI think there's a point at which comprehensiveness gives way to corpulence, a time when exhaustiveness becomes exhausting. In this book, I've tried to strike a balance between being thorough and being space-efficient. To that end, I've often truncated or clipped query result sets, especially those too wide to fit on a page and those of excessive length (I always point this out). On occasion I also list them using reduced font sizes. I don't include screenshots unless doing so benefits the discussion at hand materially (only one chapter contains any screenshots). This is in keeping with my design goal of being complete without being overwrought. Nearly 600 SQL scripts are used in this book, and they are all included in the chapters that reference them. Hopefully none of the abridgements will detract from the book's overall usefulness or value. On Formality\r\n\r\nAnother of my pet peeves is formality for the sake of formality. An artist once observed that \"it's harder to draw a good curved line than a straight one.\" What he meant was that it's in some ways more difficult to do something well for which there is no exact or stringent standard than to do something that's governed by explicit rules and stuffy precedents. All you have to do to draw a straight line is pick up a straightedge. The rules that govern formal writing, particularly that of the academic variety, make writing certain kinds of books easier because they convert much of the subjective nature of writing into something more objective. They're like training wheels on the would-be author's bicycle. Writing goes from being a creative process to a mechanical one. Cross all the T's, dot all the I's, and you're halfway there. Obviously, this relieves the author of many of the decisions that shape creative writing. It also turns otherwise good pieces of work into dreary, textbook-like dissertations that are about as interesting as the telephone book White Pages.\r\n\r\nSo, I reject the notion that formal writing is better writing, that it is a higher standard and is the ideal for which all technical writers should strive. Instead, I come from the Mark Twain school of thought--I \"eschew surplusage\"--and I believe that, so long as common methods of speech do not become overly banal (a subjective distinction, I freely admit), the ultimate goal of the technical writer should be to write the way that readers speak. It is the way people--even technical people--are most accustomed to communicating and the way they are the most able to learn and share ideas. I did not invent this way of thinking; it's simply the way most of my favorite authors--Mark Twain, Dean Koontz, Joe Celko, Ernest Hemingway, Robert Heinlein, Andrew Miller, Oscar Wilde, P. J. O'Rourke, Patricia O'Connor--write. Though it is far more difficult to structure and write a narrative that flows naturally and reads easily, it's worth the effort if the ideas the writer seeks to convey are understood as they were intended.\r\n\r\nSo, throughout this book, you'll see a number of the rules and pseudo rules of formal writing stretched, skirted, bent, and sometimes outright broken. This is intentional. Sometimes I split infinitives, begin sentences with conjunctions, and end them with prepositions. Sometimes record is used interchangeably with row; sometimes field takes the place of column; and I never, ever treat data as a plural word. I saw some software recently that displayed a message to the effect \"the data are being loaded,\" and I literally laughed out loud. The distinction between the plural data and its obscure singular form datum is not maintained in spoken language and hasn't really ever been (except, perhaps, in ancient Rome). It has also been deprecated by numerous writing guides and many authors. You will have to look very hard for an author who treats data as a plural word (I can think of only one off the top of my head, the irascible Ted Codd). The tendency for technical communication to become self-important or ostentatious has always baffled me: why stoop to pretension? Why trade the fluid conveyance of ideas between people for nonsense that confuses some and reads like petty one-upmanship to others? Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nI'd like to thank my wife, who not only makes it possible for me to write books but also makes it worthwhile. The book you see before you is as much hers as it is mine. I'd like to thank Neil Coy, who made a real programmer of me many years ago. Under Neil's tutelage, I learned software craftsmanship from a master. Joe Celko, the dean of the SQL language, has been a good friend and a valuable source of information throughout this project. Kudos to John Sarapata and Thomas Holaday for helping me come up with a title for the book (I'll keep Sybase for Dummies in mind for future use, John). Thanks to the book's technical reviewers, particularly Wayne Snyder, Gianluca Hotz, Paul Olivieri, and Ron Talmage. Heartfelt thanks to John Gmuender, Joe Gallagher, Mike Massing, and Danny Thorpe for their equanimity and for keeping me sane through the recent storm. Congratulations and genuine appreciation to the superb team at Addison-Wesley--Michael Slaughter, Marisa Meltzer, J. Carter Shanklin, and others too numerous to list. Special thanks to Nancy Cara-Sager, a friend, technical reviewer, and copyeditor who's been with me through several books and a couple of publishers now. Her tireless attention to detail has saved me from embarrassing myself more times than I can count.",

Pineapple Press has responded by bringing back into print Patrick Smith's earlier novels in \"readers,\" each with two novels in one volume. The first Patrick Smith reader offered Forever Island and Allapattah, and was eagerly welcomed. This second reader pairs two novels that offer quite a contrast in setting and topic, but they share a theme common to all of Smith's writing: the struggle of common people to live off the land.\r\n\r\nThe River is Home is the story of Skeeter, a young boy growing up in a Louisiana family poor in material goods but rich in the appreciation of their beautiful natural surroundings. The river--with its food supply, floods, steamboats--figures strongly in their lives as the source of life and death. The River is Home met with critical acclaim and launched Patrick Smith into his career as a novelist.\r\n\r\nAngel City follows the course of the Teeters, a West Virginia family come to Florida to better their lives. What they find is degradation in a migrant labor camp. Though it is repellant to believe, Smith's depiction of conditions in Florida migrant labor camps as late as the seventies was based on fact. His expose of those camps in Angel City served its intended purpose: to bring about change. As interest increases in the novels of Patrick Smith, literary historians are sure to place this near the top rank of his output.",

It is therefore logical that in most countries there has been a definite tendency to give weight to issues of adapting also the physical space to this complexity and to find methods to do this in an efficient way, giving satisfactory use of land and other natural resources. During the twentieth century we have seen a very active development of legal instruments for this purpose, aimed at steering spatial planning and plan implementation according to the objectives and policies chosen.\r\n\r\nThis book tries to present basic information of how different countries within the chosen area have tried to solve the problem of establishing suitable systems of steering spatial development by means of planning and implementation measures. For this purpose summary descriptions of the connected formal regulations in each country are given in an appendix while a comparative presentation and discussion forms the main text. This will give the interested reader an overview of the current systems in Western Europe, how they have influenced each other but still in many parts differ from each other.",

This book is unique in that it is entirely devoted to computational problems, topics that most books consider only peripherally. It considers in detail the mathematics--such as projective geometry--underlying all vision problems. Since projective geometry has been developed by mathematicians without regard to machine vision applications, this book attempts to define forms applicable to machine vision problems. The resulting formulation is termed computational projective geometry and is applied to 3-D shape analysis, camera calibration, road scene analysis, 3-D motion analysis, optical flow analysis, and conic image analysis. Special emphasis is put on robustness as it applies to data accuracy and to statistical analysis of computations based on image data. This book will be invaluable to researchers and students involved in machine vision as it applies to robotic, computer, and electrical engineering.",

His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa (Rangjung Rikpe Dorje, 1923-1981) indicated that it was his wish that Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche present Karma Chakme's Mountain Dharma to Western students. In accordance with this wish, Khenpo Rinpoche began teaching this text in the Year of the Earth Rabbit, February 1999, at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, the North American seat of His Holiness, located in Woodstock, New York. The teachings took place on weekends over the subsequent four years concluding in the Year of the Water Sheep, April 2003. The original text by Karma Chakme Rinpoche was written in the Year of the Horse, 1659. The text from which Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche taught was printed and published at Tashi Jong, Him'chal Pradesh, India, and consists of fifty-four chapters and 595 pages. Karma Chakme requested that the text always be copied and presented in its completeness to ensure that nothing be lost. Because Mountain Dharma is a complete work of the complete path, Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche follows Karma Chakme's instructions, maintaining the integrity of the original text. We also respectfully follow their wishes and instructions; however, due to the length of the text and commentary, we will publish Khenpo Rinpoche's commentary on Mountain Dharma in five volumes, with a separate volume for the Tibetan text. Rinpoche followed the same order as the original Tibetan text with two exceptions: he began with the namthar (spiritual biography) of Karma Chakme, which in the Tibetan text is at the end; Rinpoche also omitted the chapters that he considered restricted. These restricted or secret parts will be taught and published separately at Karma Ling Retreat Center for use by qualified students. The result of these efforts is that the entire contents of Karma Chakme's Mountain Dharma will be available in English for the first time.",

            "description": "[Synopsis]\r\n\r\nKip had been Chloe's best friend since childhood, sharing her deep love of nature and all its living creatures. When he is injured in an accident in the forest, trying to protect a stag from a hunter's bullet, Kip falls into a coma that puzzles his doctors. Though physically healing, he shows no signs of returning to mental consciousness. Chloe becomes convinced that he has crossed over into another world and is determined to bring her friend back to reality. With the guidance of strange creatures, including a genial beast known as Celestial Tapir, Chloe follows Kip into a wondrous and terrifying journey. She is led through magical forests and mirrored mazes, into the depths of Oceanus, and ultimately to the palace of the gods. Along the way, she befriends a whimsical collection of animal allies, as well as the heroic stag. From the animals, Chloe learns the laws of nature and the inevitable sacrifices necessary for its ultimate survival.\r\n\r\nIn the Tradition of Alice in Wonderland, the author Shigeru Takeuchi has created a magical adventure populated with colorful and profound characters who teach Chloe --- and the reader --- the value and order of all living creatures in the natural world. Elements of Buddhism, Christianity, and Greek mythology are woven into a common philosophy extolling the powers of imagination, and the sanctity of life in every form in VEGETABLE: The Man Who Transfigured Into Half Plant and Half God.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chapter 1] The Man Wrapped Up In a Black Cloak\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning, Kip! How are you this morning?\r\n\r\nChloe came into the ward of the hospital in a cheerful mood, walked up to the window with springy steps, humming in a light tone, and drew the curtain. Outside the window, some birds perching on a twig were chirping to proclaim the dawn. In spite of the snow still brooding over the mountain, trees beginning to put forth new leaves were redolent of the advent of spring that would wake up all nature. The sky was still tinged with dark blue, but the rising sun seemed to begin to cast the dawn of hope into the ward, and her eyes were lit up with the sunshine as if she were leading a sunny life.\r\n\r\nIt's a very fine day today, but I am sorry you need to stay in the bed on such a beautiful day. I wish I could take you outside.... She turned her face to Kip who strangely kept his eyes open as he lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling as if there were no soul in him, just like a doll. She gazed at him for a while as though trying not to miss any subtle movement of his facial muscle he might show. But as usual, she found no signs of improvement in him.\r\n\r\nWell, don't be disappointed, Kip, even though you can't go outside... because I have something surprising for you today.\r\n\r\nHumming some old song, she trotted back and opened the door. She brought in something big, she was holding with difficulty, and she put it on the dresser. Also on the dresser were some beautiful flowers in a vase, which she brought for Kip once a week.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for coming in so early this morning, but I know you've already awakened, as usual. Do you know why I came so early today? I couldn't wait any longer to show you this wonderful thing. I teased my dad into buying this. What do you think this would be? Well, take a guess, said Chloe with an air of importance. Ta-daa.\r\n\r\nShe opened the box and lifted something out. It was a television.\r\n\r\nYou liked to watch PBS and Discovery channels, didn't you? I asked my dad to allow me to let you watch TV. Of course, he was not pleased, but I wheedled him into letting me set it up, including cable channels. Everything is to be set up by tomorrow, so be patient. You can watch anything you like then.\r\n\r\nBecause the TV was sitting beside the flowers in the vase, she moved the flowers and put them beside the window where they could enjoy the brisk sunshine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Chloe heard the sound of someone opening the door. She promptly turned around in surprise. It was a nurse, who was also surprised at her presence since nobody except Kip was supposed to be there.\r\n\r\nFlora! Chloe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\nChloe? How did you get in? Flora asked.\r\n\r\nI am sorry...I sneaked in. Chloe looked down. I used my dad's spare key to get in the hospital. But please don't tell him, because I borrowed it secretly.\r\n\r\nChloe was well known to everybody working there since she was the daughter of Dr. Rorschach, who was head of the hospital. She appeared to feel contrite, but she soon looked at Flora with imploring eyes and asked her favor as if she were talking to her friend.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Flora N. Gale was Chloe's best friend, whom she thought of as an elder sister she could consult about any personal affairs. In addition, Flora was a very beautiful and attractive lady, yet her beauty was not feminine attraction for men. It was, rather, personal magnetism that attracted all people by her heart like a beautiful flower, fascinating everyone and giving them peace of mind. Chloe also had such a trait, so many patients thought they were sisters, and some of them who were deeply depressed often asked Flora to convince her sister to work as a nurse with her. Flora had often suggested to Dr. Rorschach that Chloe should study psychiatry. She had even made many other proposals to him for improvements in the hospital. One of them was to change the color of the nurses' uniforms from the traditional white to a faintly bluish-white color because blue was considered as the color psychologically associated with security and peace. He soon approved it. This surprised many other nurses because he was thought to be a straitlaced doctor. But Flora knew he always thought of his patients first before everything else and was actually warm at heart. He was a respectable doctor to her.\r\n\r\nHowever he had one fault: He was an indulgent father to Chloe. He granted whatever she desired and had never reproved her. If there was something he could never allow her to do, he always asked Flora to admonish Chloe not to do it.\r\n\r\nWell, you've done the same before...I told you that you shouldn't do it, even if your father is the head of this hospital, said Flora firmly, but not angrily.\r\n\r\nI know. But please excuse me again. Today is special! I couldn't wait to show this TV to him, said Chloe, showing it to Flora.\r\n\r\nWow, you brought it? Did Dr. Rorschach say okay to set it up here?\r\n\r\nYeah. You know, he cannot refuse to grant my wish since he is indulgent to me. He reluctantly said okay, although he seemed to want to say this was a senseless idea.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is ridiculous. Kip cannot see anything, much less think at all because he's been in a persistent vegetative state. You know that, don't you? So, I don't understand why you brought it here. What do you want to do with it?\r\n\r\nI know everybody thinks he is vegetable...I know a vegetable doesn't have normal mind like we do..., said Chloe.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of heavy silence between her and Flora.\r\n\r\nBut he is different..., she continued. He must be able to think. Inside his mind, he must be reacting to our conversation. He merely cannot express his thoughts or emotions.\r\n\r\nSilly idea, Chloe. How do you know he can think?\r\n\r\nI just know somehow...I am sure he can think. I don't know how I can explain about it, but please believe me!\r\n\r\nWell, is that why you've brought the TV here to let him watch?\r\n\r\nYeah, Chloe simply said and looked at his eyes that looked like cold glass beads. They were still gazing at the ceiling. His eyes may not be focusing on anything, but I think he can at least hear. I think he can enjoy listening to TV programs such as PBS or Discovery Channel that he used to love before.\r\n\r\nFlora was dumbfounded at Chloe's remark, but she tried to understand Chloe who dedicated herself to take care of him every day. She finally said, Well, I hope so....\r\n\r\nI hope so, too, said Chloe, and then her countenance fell. Do you know what I am thinking now, Flora?\r\n\r\nFlora didn't utter anything and just shook her head.\r\n\r\nYou may think I am strange to say such a thing, but I'm seriously saying I think his soul is not damaged at all. It has been kept intact even though he was physically injured in the terrible accident. You've heard about near-death experience, haven't you? People who have had such an experience often insist that their spiritual bodies or astral bodies came out of their physical ones when dying, and they floated around. Some of them even say they tried to let doctors know they were not dead yet and where they actually were, but nobody could listen to them. In the same way, Kip may be disembodied from his physical body and wandering around in the air. He may be hearing us from somewhere while suffering from no means to communicate, Chloe anxiously but fervently said.\r\n\r\nFlora noticed Chloe's eyes were suffused with tears, so she tried to appease her.\r\n\r\nThen Kip suddenly coughed twice.\r\n\r\nKip! Chloe was instantly back at his bedside, looking at his eyes in surprise and with hope of his recovery. But they still looked like cold glass beads. Kip! Kip! You came around, didn't you? Kip! Can you hear me? She shook his shoulders, but he didn't respond at all.\r\n\r\nStop it, Chloe. Flora tenderly said and prevented Chloe from shaking him. It is a sporadic reflex.\r\n\r\nNo! It isn't just a reflex! He must be coming back into his physical body! Chloe lost her presence of mind and cried out in contrast with the serene air of spring.\r\n\r\nFlora didn't respond to her immediately and kept silence while thinking about what she should say.\r\n\r\nWell, she again opened her mouth after Chloe sank wearily into a chair with sorrow. Have you read the Bible before, Chloe? If I remember right, I think there is a line in Psalms saying 'Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death.' In another words, if you could give light to his eyes, he would wake from the sleep of death. Though it is a metaphor, I guess that's how you are trying to make him come around, isn't it? I hope that will work. But I'm not in a position to tell you anything definite about philosophical or religious matters. As you know, I am a nurse. So, I hope you would not take it amiss because I'm going to tell you as a matter of duty...well, I am sorry to say that he is in a persistent vegetative state. As you may know, his brain is almost dead. But his brain stem is still alive so that he shows a number of basic functions such as digestion, assimilation, respiration, and circulation of the blood. He even shows cycles of sleep and wakefulness with his eyes open and pupillary responses to light. The coughs he had were one of the basic functions, too. But these functions just keep him alive. He has lost all abilities to lead a normal life. He even cannot move nor talk, much less think at all. Unfortunately, there is no way to cure him in the current medicine so far. The only thing we can do is to keep him alive like this.\r\n\r\nDo you mean you are going to let him remain in an unconscious state until he dies? What would you think if nobody woke you up from sleep until you died? He is merely in the same state as he sleeps. It is just an extreme case. So, we need to wake him up from the comatose condition! Chloe was on the verge of tears, when somebody's hand was put tenderly on her shoulder as if trying to appease her sorrow. When she turned her face, Kip's parents were standing behind her. She jumped up from the chair, leaned against Kip's father, and drooped her head dejectedly against his chest.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Christina Ziyang, was standing behind him with her handkerchief against her eyes. She said, her lips trembling with woe, Chloe, we appreciate all you so kindly did for Kip, but you don't have any obligation to do that. As Flora said, there is nothing we can do for him. We can never see his affectionate smile again. He has already begun to follow the path to his last home. And I believe, in the fullness of time, he will go to heaven.\r\n\r\nIn terms of Buddhism, said Kip's father, Wang Ziyang, who was from China, it is called Nirvana. He will enter Nirvana after several repetitions of birth by Karma. Although he is now straying off from the circles of transmigration, I believe that he will find his own right way after the lapse of time. Unlike Christina he seemed to keep his presence of mind.\r\n\r\nNo! That's not correct! Chloe cried out, perturbed by their words. What do you think Christ would do if he saw Kip? What do you think Buddha would do if he were here? They would know it was not time for him to pass away! They would say he has just been groping for his way in the dark to come back into his physical body. He needs somebody's hand leading him to the right way.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had been coming to the hospital every day to determine how she could make Kip come around, nobody really understood what she was doing. In fact, when she asked her father to commit Kip to the hospital, everybody was opposed to her idea. Because Dr. Rorschach was professional in not only psychiatry but also psychosomatic medicine and psychosurgery, she thought he could cure Kip who had still been unconscious after he was operated on at another hospital where he had first been taken. However, Dr. Rorschach had no idea why Kip had not regained consciousness. Everybody had already given up and lost hope in spite of Chloe's eager efforts to help him recover.\r\n\r\nShe was suddenly seized with worry about whether she was really doing the right thing. As she noticed tears trickling down her cheek, she fled the room and ran out of the ward in the fullness of her grief.\r\n\r\nI feel pity for her, said Christina. She must be laying the blame on herself. That's why she comes here every day to take care of him out of the sense of sin.\r\n\r\nWell, I don't want to let her grieve any more. I will ask Dr. Rorschach not to let her come and see Kip hereafter, said Wang with a sigh of grief.\r\n\r\nWhen Chloe rushed out of the ward, she couldn't see her way through her tear-filled eyes. But she just ran, drooping her head so that nobody in the hospital could see her tear-stained face.\r\n\r\nWhen she got out of the hospital, she bumped her head against somebody.\r\n\r\nI am sorry. She knew it was impolite, but she tried to run keeping her head down with just those words. However, the person opened his arm and barred her way. She raised her head in surprise and found a man wrapped up in a black cloak and hat. His clothes were all black and suggestive of something sinister.\r\n\r\nDon't try to look into his profound mind, said the man plainly in a low voice. Otherwise you will expose yourself to danger.\r\n\r\nWho are you? What are you talking about? Chloe demanded with a frown.\r\n\r\nThe man didn't answer but simply said, His mind is now in the profound darkness that is very difficult and dangerous to look into. Strangely he didn't change an expression on his face at all, fixing his unblinking eyes through his sunglasses on her. To her he looked as if he had no emotion.\r\n\r\nWho is he? Whose mind are you talking about?\r\n\r\nA friend from your childhood.\r\n\r\nA friend from my childhood...? Kip? Are you talking about Kip?\r\n\r\nThe man continued, saying flatly, It may be easy to read another's mind by looking at his or her eyes, attitude, facial expression, or tone of voice. But appearances are often deceptive. It is just like looking at only the surface of the sea to know what is going on in the profound. If you want to know, you must try to look into it. But you will be involved with some risk. The deeper you go the greater the risk you will have...such as greater water pressure. The abyss is not a place for you to go. It will exclude anything from the external world. Likewise, the abyss of the mind is dangerous to sound out, because it is the very exclusive realm of mind and is not a place you can enter.\r\n\r\nThen, somebody opened and closed the door of the main entrance of the hospital with a slam. Chloe turned her face in surprise and looked back. It was Flora, who ran up to Chloe with worry.\r\n\r\nThere you are. I was looking for you. Are you all right? Don't be disappointed at what they said. They are merely upset now since they were told there was no way to cure their son by current methods of medicine. But you believe in your father, don't you? He is the best doctor I've ever met; he will definitely make Kip come around. So, you don't have any obligation to take care of him. That's actually my job. Don't take it away from me, said Flora in a soft voice with a tender smile.\r\n\r\nBut..., said Chloe, choking with tears. If I hadn't forced him to go to the forest...if I had listened to him seriously...nothing would have happened to him, and we could study at the university together.\r\n\r\nShe was trying to suppress her grief, but her eyes already overflowed with tears. Flora let her cry with no more words.\r\n\r\nThere was leaden silence between them for a while, but Chloe again started to talk with difficulty. You know, he was interested in the relationship between human history and nature. He used to watch TV programs about it since he was young. And I don't know exactly when, but he came to wonder how mythology developed interacting with sublime nature in human history. He said he would study history, ecology, and mythology at university. He was so much looking forward to studying there.... She dropped her head down on Flora's shoulder and sobbed. But I didn't think such a terrible accident would happen to him.\r\n\r\nFlora tenderly patted Chloe on the back and said, That is not your fault. That just happened. Since nobody can predict the future, nobody could prevent it from happening. She pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket and wiped Chloe's tears with it. Stop crying now. If you think Kip's soul is seeing us from somewhere, he is laughing at you. She smiled in order to soften the edge of Chloe's grief.\r\n\r\nChloe tried to smile back, but she could not suppress her tears.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the ward to get your backpack. It is time to go to school, isn't it? said Flora and took Chloe back in the hospital.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the ward, Chloe looked back over her shoulder, but the man with the black cloak was not there any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chapter 2] Fate\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFreud had postulated that dream was healing through hallucinatory wish-fulfillment and a way of protecting the dreamer from unconscious anxieties that....\u201d\r\n\r\nThose words were coming to Chloe, but she was in a daze and was not paying attention to the lecture at all. Instead, she was staring at a dead tree outside the window with her chin resting on her one hand and twiddling the pendant hanging from her neck with the other hand. The pendant was one in the shape of a \u201ccaduceus,\u201d the symbol of medicine whose shape was a stick attached to a pair of bird wings and around which two serpents twined. Although her father had presented it to her with a wish that she should go to medical school, she was actually studying psychology at the university. Certain hopes in her seemed to encourage her to study it, but today she felt different. All day at school, she had been so distracted and lackadaisical, she didn\u2019t know exactly where she was and what she was doing, although she in fact drove to school by herself, and her feet took her to the classroom as usual. Disoriented, she was indulging in reminiscence.\r\n\r\nShe had developed an interest in psychometry or clairvoyance, that is, supernatural power to perceive things beyond the scope of normal human senses. She hoped she might utilize it to find out why Kip was still in unconscious state, in spite of the fact that he was operated on successfully. So, she appealed to her father to let her study psychology. Although she didn\u2019t tell him why she was interested in it, he was not opposed to it because he wanted her to be either a psychiatrist or a psychosurgeon. However, that was not the only reason why she wanted to study the subject. She was rather interested in her own innate ability or one she might have acquired since she was young. She didn\u2019t know if it was really psychometrical ability; it might be totally different. But whatever it was, she didn\u2019t care. The important thing was the fact that she could understand the feeling of animals or even plants as she went to the forest near Kip\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nChloe and Kip had grown up together. Their parents used to take them to the forest for picnics or camping. At that time, she didn\u2019t think it was unusual to talk to nature there. She thought everybody could do it as naturally as talking to people. But when she told her father about her ability, he didn\u2019t take it seriously since she was not mature enough to explain it well. She was a little embarrassed, but as she grew up, she realized nobody except her could understand any feelings of nature. And she had a glimmer of the fact that it was not based on any language, since animals or plants didn\u2019t think in it. She actually could feel something ineffable from nature.\r\n\r\nSome years later, after Chloe and Kip started to go to elementary school, she moved to another town where Dr. Rorschach had become a hospital chief of staff. Since the town was far from where Kip was living, they went to different schools. At that time Chloe had no means to go to the forest where she had gone in her childhood until she graduated from junior high school. But when she became able to drive a car legally, her father let her go to the same high school with Kip.\r\n\r\nWhen she first met him at school, he didn\u2019t seem to have changed at all. At least, she thought so. He still had an innocent look and was full of wonder and interest in the mystery of nature. In fact, he often studied it himself by roving the forest near his house with respect toward its solemnity.\r\n\r\nOne day, he told her he had found a stag in the forest that was very tame and showed affection for him. It was majestic and splendid. Chloe listened to his story in excitement. She asked him to take her to the place where he had found it, and he said he would that Friday afternoon. \r\n\r\nWaiting for Friday was tormenting to her. In all her classes all week, she constantly thought of and imagined how wonderful the stag would be, instead of paying attention to the lectures.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the school was dismissed on Friday, she drove her car directly to Kip\u2019s house without going back home. She bubbled with excitement at the possibility of somehow conversing with the stag. However, she was a little worried about Kip because he hadn\u2019t come to school that day. In fact, as days passed since he had told about the stag, he seemed to become depressed. Sometimes he rambled about something mysterious or even eerie, such as \u201cMan is a bubble...Is this really true?\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the inscrutable decrees of providence.\u201d She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what he meant and didn\u2019t know that something similar to prophecy was being revealed in his remarks.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of such worries, Chloe enjoyed the refreshing air of late spring blowing into her car on the way to Kip\u2019s house. The serene sky filled her heart with ineffable joy. However, when she reached his house, she was a little disturbed by a strange moth she found. It flew across her car and hung on the door of the house. She had never seen such a moth before. It had a mark like a skull on its back, which seemed suggestive of memento mori. She was soon seized with indescribable images, feelings, and words associated with \u201cdeath,\u201d and they echoed in her mind. She stared at the moth and wondered if the echo was coming from it. But it soon flew away, and the echo ceased. She followed it with her eyes for a while, but it fluttered beyond the roof of the house and disappeared out of her sight. Then she forgot about it and knocked on the door, but nobody answered. She knocked on it again, loudly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody is there.\u201d\r\n\r\nChloe heard the low voice from outside. It was Kip\u2019s. He was lounging in a hammock hanging from the laurels in the garden. He was gazing up at the sky with a serious face, plaintively tootling on a reed pipe. These were his favorite trees, from which he used to make laurel crowns for Chloe when they were children. But the pale greenish yellow blooms that were in full blossom now were beginning to fall off the trees in spite of the pleasant spring weather. \r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you are there! How are you doing, Kip?\u201d said Chloe cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Kip said flatly, but he seemed glum as if depressed about his life.\r\n\r\nChloe frowned at his dejected voice, but ignoring the dismal atmosphere, she asked him with the curiosity of a child about the moth she had seen.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know what, Kip? I saw an interesting moth on the door just now. It had a skull mark on its back! I have never seen such a strange moth before. Do you know what it was?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe thought it would arouse his curiosity, but he remained gloomy. She noticed that her words made him turn pale. He seemed to feign calm, but she felt he was scared of something.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is called a death\u2019s-head moth,\u201d said Kip plainly in a low voice. \u201cThe scientific name is Acherontia atropos. But I don\u2019t think we can find it in such a place.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled slightly, but it was noticeable to Chloe, who then realized his entire body was quivering as the leaves of trees trembled in the breeze that caused the blossoms to fall off.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Chloe, staring at him with wonder about whether he simply shivered with chill. \u201cWell, I might be confused with an optical illusion. It looked like a skull to my eyes, but it might be just a mark.\u201d She didn\u2019t insist any further that it really looked like a skull because she didn\u2019t want to worry him, although she was certain it was a skull-like shape, and the clear eidetic image remained in her mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, Kip, are you ready to go now?\u201d asked Chloe, suddenly changing the subject. She wanted to let him forget about the moth in hopes of dispelling the dismal air surrounding him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere am I going?\u201d asked Kip dully.\r\n\r\nAs she suspected, he didn\u2019t seem to remember that he was to take her to the forest. \r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, to the forest where you found the stag. Don\u2019t you remember you said you would show me the wonderful stag you had found?\u201d said Chloe, suppressing her irritation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I am sorry, I don\u2019t want to go today.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust because I don\u2019t feel well now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, you should go there. Don\u2019t you want to feel a breath of vigorous nature? It is a very fine day today to go there! The serene weather, the limpid air, the bracing warble of birds. These will give you life and make you feel its joy! Ah, I cannot wait any longer to go,\u201d said Chloe with rapture shining on her face. She beamed with verdant innocence. It even made Kip relax his tense face, and he couldn\u2019t help chuckling at her seraphic face, but he tried to suppress it and maintain a reserved attitude.\r\n\r\nShe scowled her disappointment because she had been tingling with excitement and curiosity to see the stag.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think the lovely stag is waiting for you?\u201d She still tried to persuade him to take her to the forest like a willful child, and to Kip\u2019s eyes, the image of her innocent young face now replaced the angelic countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat frown doesn\u2019t suit your loveliness at all. All right, I\u2019ll take you there. Give me a minute,\u201d said Kip. His face was lit up by a smile, but it was a faintly reminiscent one.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was obvious to Chloe he was trying to smile his fear away, she didn\u2019t know what he was worried about, and she just hoped the affectionate tame stag would cheer him up.\r\n\r\nKip drove his own vehicle to take Chloe to the forest. He used to bicycle and hike there when he was young, but now he had his own truck. It was very convenient to carry his camping goods and equipment for his study. It was a powerful four-wheel-drive vehicle that ran on the rugged road without any difficulty. Chloe wanted to ask if Kip had taken a detour because it was a longer drive than she remembered from her childhood, but she just hung on without talking in order not to bite her tongue until he parked the car at the end of the road.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind walking from here, do you?\u201d Kip asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Chloe answered in excitement.\r\n\r\nBut Kip, who got out of the truck with his backpack, didn\u2019t appear to be happy at all. Trying to maintain a cheerful spirit, she said, \u201cAh, this smell of the trees makes me remember the pleasant day we spent in our childhood. You often found something new and vexed your parents by asking what it was. You even picked up a praying mantis with no head and showed it to your mom, but she screamed and pushed it away. Do you remember?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Kip, embarrassed, but his words brought a smile to his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, everything was so interesting to me. There are so many kinds of living things present here. They lead their lives quietly but dynamically interacting with others in this ecosystem. Some of them can\u2019t be seen; they don\u2019t even have any names. And without being known by anybody, they are born and die. Some of them are even eaten by others. In spite of their fate of death, they are born in this forest. I always wondered about it, and I wished to know the answer to the question, \u2018Why do they struggle to survive and to reproduce before they die.\u2019 I wondered if they would continue it forever. My father used to try to explain it with Buddhism when I was a kid.\u201d\r\n\r\nKip glanced at Chloe then continued. \u201cYou remember my father is from China, don\u2019t you? He often talked about metempsychosis, which means we transmigrate into another physical body after we die. Your next form of life is determined depending on your conducts in your previous life. You may be born as a human again or as a bug. But you never know. And through the cycles of births and deaths that are almost eternal, you may experience the perfect spiritual awakening. Then you can reach Nirvana. I didn\u2019t understand the concept very well at that time, but I remember that it was a fascinating idea to my very young mind. Although he didn\u2019t talk about it when your family was present since they were Christian, he often tried to explain to my mother. She is Christian, too, but she showed an interest in it and often asked him if it was something like reincarnation believed among Gnostics, that is, people who belonged to one sect of Christianity in ancient time. But whenever they started to discuss the difference between Buddhism and Christianity, I quit listening to them and began searching for something new in this forest. I was not interested in religion itself. I was actually interested in what he told me. He said everything had some reason to be born in the form of what they were.\u201d\r\n\r\n Then Chloe interrupted him and said, \u201cIf so, there must be some reason that the strange moth I saw had a skull-like stain on its back.\u201d It was her innocent wonder reacting to his philosophizing, but she immediately stopped talking because she realized he was frowning on her remark.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s quit rambling about such a subject. We have a long walk today. Keep your stamina and just follow me. Don\u2019t stray off,\u201d Kip said flatly, in a low voice. Once again he became gloomy looking and just walked into the dense forest. Chloe followed him without talking any more. But she wanted to ask him why he was going into such a dark, woodsy place. It was definitely different from the image of the forest she had in her mind. She wondered if the forest had changed since she had come there in her childhood. But she thought what had actually changed was Kip, not the forest. The first time she saw him in high school, he was the same as he used to be in his childhood. But he was different today. If he were the same person, he would have showed some kind of interest in the moth she found. But he actually looked frightened when she talked about it.\r\n\r\nWhile she was thinking of these things, he was just walking deep into the forest in silence, never looking back to make sure if she was following him without any difficulty. As they walked deeper and deeper into the forest, it became dense, the air became cooler, and the mist hung dimly around them. She had no idea where she was going. It made her realize that she had never come to this part of the forest.\r\n\r\nWhile lost in her thoughts, she heard a muffled roaring. Kip stopped walking, cupping his hand behind the ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this noise? Is it a waterfall?\u201d asked Chloe hesitantly, sensitive to Kip\u2019s mood.\r\n\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d answered Kip, but he was not interested in the waterfall. What concerned him was actually the sound plaintively rapped out somewhere. Although Chloe didn\u2019t notice it, he knew it was made by deathwatch beetles, and he was apprehensive of some impending danger unknown to Chloe.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a waterfall here! Is there a basin below the waterfall where we can swim? Should I\u2019ve taken a swimsuit with me?\u201d Chloe was so excited that she promptly jerked his hand, without noticing that his countenance had changed again, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go faster!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she started to think about how gorgeous the waterfall would be, she got over the fatigue of the long walk and almost forgot about the stag they were looking for. As the roar of the waterfall became louder, she walked with light steps, but Kip was still plodding along. She didn\u2019t know how long she had walked, but it didn\u2019t matter to her. She just wanted to see the place where they were destined as soon as she could. She thought it would be a beautifully preserved place, since the dense forest where they were walking was isolated from the outside world. So, even when she needed to struggle over the moss-covered, rugged ground, she continued to make a headway.\r\n\r\nWhen the warble of a bird came audible, she thrilled with joy and began to croon a song of accompaniment, while Kip\u2019s silence was contrast with the bird she thought was welcoming them. It even seemed to be speaking to Chloe, looking down at her from the tree. When she noticed that, it flapped off the branch and flew around in the sky.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be trying to tell us something!\u201d She was so excited she couldn\u2019t help talking back. \u201cHello. Can you hear me? What do you want to tell us? Please let us know!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bird with brownish plumage flitted down to the ground and soared again to the sky. She gazed at it without understanding. Then it repeated its actions. \u201cI think it\u2019s trying to show us something on the ground!\u201d She trotted to the spot where the bird flew down and carefully looked around, but she didn\u2019t find anything. She looked up at the bird again, but it was just watching her from the branch of the tree. Although she could feel the bird trying to show her something, it was hard for her to know more than that. She turned her eyes back to Kip, though he didn\u2019t seem interested in anything that might be shown by the bird. \r\n\r\n\u201cKip, do you know what kind of bird it is and what it\u2019s trying to show us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nightingale...I think. But I\u2019m not sure though because it is unusual that it warbles in the daylight,\u201d said Kip and frowned about the bird\u2019s strange behavior.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is it unusual?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it is nocturnal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, even so, I think it can\u2019t help warbling on such a beautiful day,\u201d Chloe simply guessed as if the bird were also enjoying the warm spring day. \u201cKip, do you have any idea about what it\u2019s trying to show us? I can\u2019t find anything interesting,\u201dshe asked just like a curious child.\r\n\r\nBut he said bluntly, \u201cLook carefully around the moss and grass on the ground.\u201d\r\nShe looked closely at the ground for a while and finally found something strange. \u201cKip! What is this? There is a dark green circle of the grass on the ground. The color of the grass is slightly different from that of grass outside the circle, and the circle is enclosed by many mushrooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fairy ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fairy ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a trace left after fairies gave a dance there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know fairies were real. I thought they were simply characters in a fancy tale.\u201d Her heart danced with joy and surprise, but Kip\u2019s next words dampened her enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is just a superstition, though. The ring is, in fact, formed as a result of the radial growth of mycelia, that is, fungi. From year to year, they grow under the ground, and the ring becomes larger and larger. As they grow, they kill grass by depriving it of nutrients in the soil. However, the grass can soon grow again from the underground roots. That\u2019s why the color of the grass is subtly different from that of grass outside the ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know what these mushrooms are called?\u201d Chloe asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe most common mushroom forming a fairy ring is Marasmius oreades.\r\nIt is very palatable and has a nutty taste.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWow. Your father might be pleased if I we bring them home. He cooks many strange plants to serve delicious dishes, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it is Marasmius oreades. Because it lacks prominent features, it is difficult for me to identify. Some of mushrooms growing in a ring are even poisonous, so be careful if you want to eat them.\u201d\r\n\r\nChloe promptly stepped back away from the mushrooms in surprise. \r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t know why they are in such a place. They are generally seen in a grassy area such as a lawn or meadow. Look at the ground around you. There are only moss and ferns growing. But only at that spot, there is grass making the fairy ring....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do you think this would be a real fairy ring for dancing because it is unlikely to be formed here naturally?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. It probably formed here just by accident,\u201d Kip answered in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHis answer made her look sadly up at the bird. \u201cWell, you thought this was a real fairy ring, didn\u2019t you?\u201d There was no answer from the bird, which flapped off the branch again and flew over her head. Then it flew with a chirp in the direction they were originally headed. Regaining her hopefulness, she jerked Kip\u2019s hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s follow the bird! It will lead us to the place we want to go!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tried to encourage him and made his reluctant feet run. As the memories of childhood raced through her mind, she ran joyfully, hand in hand with Kip.\r\n\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Chloe jerked her hand with sudden, prickly pain and came to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d said Kip, who then pulled gloves out of his backpack. \u201cPut these on. Those plants are called stinging nettles. They have numerous small bristles that have formic acid. Your hand must be tingling now, but it will go away in ten to fifteen minutes. So be patient and don\u2019t touch them again, though you will find a lot of those plants as we get closer to the glade we are seeking. Don\u2019t run again. Let\u2019s walk carefully now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough he was still serious and looked different from the way he used to be, Chloe thought that he had a calm attitude toward nature and showed his knowledge.\r\nSo, she decided to just follow him as he carefully pushed his way through the cluster of those plants. They were taller than she was and very densely thriving so that she could not see anything beyond them. She even became frightened because she couldn\u2019t help thinking again that the place where they were going might be really an isolated area that would not allow anyone from the external world to enter.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as the cluster of those plants separated after about an hour\u2019s walk, her fear disappeared as beautiful views she had never seen before opened before her eyes. The glade was embosomed among the forest trees and mountains. The water streaming from the mountains fell down into a huge basin that was very calm and reflected the serene sky, contrary to the torrential water in the cascade. The wavering shadows of leaves trembling in the breeze were reflected on the surface of the water, and waterfowls were gracefully sailing on it. Butterflies fluttered from flower to flower in the garden of light glinting in the clouds of spray from the cascades. They looked as if they were fairies romping and disporting among the flowers, synchronizing their movements with the warble of birds. It was, in fact, the grandest sight imaginable to Chloe who was amazed by the grandeur of nature and transfixed at the sight. She even noticed that various animals were basking around the bank of the basin. To her, the sight seemed to be a lifespring on the knees of the gods.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey, look at the other side of the bank!\u201d said Kip, urging her to awaken from her reverie. He seemed elated to show her the place as if he showed off the beauty of his mother who cuddled him to drive away his anxiety. His face even warmed to a smile at Mother Nature, and his eyes were sparkling with delight.\r\n\r\nChloe promptly turned to face the other side of the bank and found the stag he had talked about lowering its head to drink water. It was very splendid and majestic, showing its dignity as if it were the monarch of the forest. She was struck with a feeling of awe and didn\u2019t notice the gloom had almost completely disappeared from Kip\u2019s face. But it was no longer of concern to her, and she began to run joyously toward the stag.\r\n\r\nShe was the same as she had been in her childhood. Her innocent face glowed with the splendor of light shining on the mist of precious stone sprayed from the cascades, and those pouring gems were beautifully reflected on the surface of water in the basin. Kip, who was staring at the angelic and childlike Chloe, felt as if this place had created a world of its own far beyond his mundane world.\r\n\r\nBANG, BAAAANG!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, reports of gunfire reverberated. They rent the air above the roaring of the torrential cascades. All animals there immediately became cautious and on the lookout for danger. Some of them bristled at the noise, and the others ran away in a flurry. Birds in the forest took alarm and immediately flew away with a screech. The balmy spring day in the clouds disintegrated into panic in a moment. The glassy surface of the calm basin reflecting the serene sky was broken up by waterfowls in their panic to take off. Chloe was astounded and stood petrified, looking around wildly.\r\n\r\n\u201cKip! What is going on?\u201d shouted Chloe but her words were drowned out by the roaring of the cascades and screams of animals and birds. She didn\u2019t know what to do and just crouched down on the ground, shrinking with fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn it! Somebody must have awakened Pan. I didn\u2019t think this place had already been found by hunters,\u201d said Kip in a furious voice, and he turned his eyes to the stag. It bounded toward the river and jumped in. All animals were scuttling off, but the stag was running in the direction of the gunfire. Kip knew what the stag would do, so he flung his backpack on the ground and ran after it as fast as he could. Chloe didn\u2019t know where he was going, but she pursued him with her eyes, still crouching on the ground. The stag crossed the river without any difficulty and disappeared into the forest, while Kip had to choose a part of the river as shallow as possible. He struggled against the current, but he never took his eyes off the stag and made sure which way it went into the forest. A few seconds after the stag disappeared into a clump of trees, reports of gunfire rent the air again.\r\n\r\n\u201cKip! Where are you going?\u201d Chloe shouted, but her voice never reached him as he pursued the stag. So, she tried to run after him, plucking up courage and crossing the river fearfully.\r\n\r\nWhen Kip found the stag in a forest glade, it was standing with a maniacal expression of rage in front of hunters. One of them lay dying on the ground, groaning with pain. Kip knew the hunter had been stabbed by the antlers of the stag because the ground was stained with his blood.\r\n\r\nWrithing in agony, the hunter said with a faint, choking voice, \u201cOooh...it must be...possessed by an evil spirit...,\u201d and then he breathed his last. The stag was also smeared with blood oozing from the gunshot wounds, but it was glaring, without a moan of pain, at the other hunter who held a shotgun at the stag. He was trembling with fright at the diabolically callous eyes of the stag. They appeared impenetrable, but Kip knew they were ones full of lament and rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d said Kip, casting his compassionate eyes on the stag.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease quell your anger. I don\u2019t want you to turn this fair earth into a pool of blood; otherwise I cannot beg the mercy of Pan.\u201d He tried to appease its rage, but it was on the verge of attacking the hunter. While Kip struggled to stop the bleeding from the wound in the stag\u2019s belly by covering it with his hand, the hunter roared, seething with conflicting emotions between fear of the stag and anger that it had killed his partner. \u201cGet off the stag, boy! I\u2019ll take the final crack at the goddamn creature!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! You cannot do that! Open up your eyes and look at what you did. You have already induced Pan\u2019s rage. He is fretful on waking, though he is a god\u2014the god of woods. This is well known among herdsmen so they share his favor of the forest with the greatest possible care. But once his sleep is disturbed in this slumberous golden afternoon, no one can appease his revengeful wrath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about!? Pan? The god of woods? His revenge? I don\u2019t believe such mythology!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you to get out of this forest; otherwise, you will need to pay the debt of nature,\u201d said Kip plainly, controlling his anger and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho the hell you think you are!? I am not afraid of anything!\u201d The hunter was nearly driven mad by Kip\u2019s remark. \u201cI\u2019ll quiet the devil with one more shot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you again. Get out of this forest before the stag kills you with Pan\u2019s rage. Death doesn\u2019t pay all scores...it\u2019ll be too late to repent of your mortal sin on your deathbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo hell with such cobwebs of superstition! You get off the stag! It already tasted blood. I have to put an end to such a beast\u2019s life!\u201d \r\n\r\nAt that very moment as the hunter aimed the gun at the stag, it broke out of Kip\u2019s hand and pounced on the hunter furiously.\r\n\r\nBAAAANG!\r\n\r\nThe last report of gunfire rent the air, but the scattered buckshots actually rained from behind. While the hunter fell under the antlers of the stag, Kip slowly collapsed just like a tree toppling to the ground after being cut for timber. Some of the buckshots pierced his back and turned the ground into a veritable pool of blood.\r\n\r\nThere was, in fact, a third hunter behind who shot them. He was staring at the stag falling to the ground.",

Thereafter, she was sentenced to three years in the Gulag and three years in exile in Siberia. The conclusion was inevitable: a broken spirit, another crushed Catholic to be used in the Communist cause.\r\n\r\nBut Nijole Sadunaite wouldn't crush.

Here, for the first time, she presents the dramatic account of her precarious family life under an enemy regime, her own defense of the Church, her trial, imprisonment and exile, and her continued efforts to serve Our Lord while evading the ever-watchful KGB.\r\n\r\n\"A Radiance in the Gulag\" is the story of one woman's challenge to the vast power of an atheistic state - a truly awe-inspiring story of courage, faith and love.",

But in 1994 her idyllic world was ripped apart as Rwanda descended into a bloody genocide. Immaculee's family was brutally murdered during a killing spree that lasted three months and claimed the lives of nearly a million Rwandans. Incredibly, Immaculee survived the slaughter. For 91 days, she and seven other women huddled silently together in the cramped bathroom of a local pastor while hundreds of machete-wielding killers hunted for them. It was during those endless hours of unspeakable terror that Immaculee discovered the power of prayer, eventually shedding her fear of death and forging a profound and lasting relationship with God. She emerged from her bathroom hideout having discovered the meaning of truly unconditional love \u2014 a love so strong she was able seek out and forgive her family s killers.

Like deja vu, it apparent to him that we are facing situations that seem strangely similar if not precisely the same as nearly forty years ago.  \r\n\r\nPresident Barak Obama could easily step into the same quicksand, because that is metaphorically what it is, if he is not careful.  C. J. Jung might see our new president as the archetypical leader destined to return the United States to the citadel on the hill.  He certainly has his work cut out for him.  \r\n\r\nConsider this: for far too long the US Congress has stayed the same, has missed the changes, hasn't had the fortitude to face them, and consequently, it has left the future up for grabs.  \r\n\r\nA LOOK BACK TO SEE AHEAD asks the reader to see how little has changed, and why attempting to solve our problems with the same thinking that created them can no longer be tolerated.  Dr. Fisher describes the problem.  He feels there is no shortage of experts who would provide the prescription, hopefully, with the caveat he offers here.",

Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past?\r\n\r\nGreene uses these questions to guide us toward modern science\u2019s new and deeper understanding of the universe. From Newton\u2019s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein\u2019s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics\u2019 entangled arena where vastly distant objects can bridge their spatial separation to instantaneously coordinate their behavior or even undergo teleportation, Greene reveals our world to be very different from what common experience leads us to believe. Focusing on the enigma of time, Greene establishes that nothing in the laws of physics insists that it run in any particular direction and that \u201ctime\u2019s arrow\u201d is a relic of the universe\u2019s condition at the moment of the big bang. And in explaining the big bang itself, Greene shows how recent cutting-edge developments in superstring and M-theory may reconcile the behavior of everything from the smallest particle to the largest black hole. This startling vision culminates in a vibrant eleven-dimensional \u201cmultiverse,\u201d pulsating with ever-changing textures, where space and time themselves may dissolve into subtler, more fundamental entities.\r\n\r\nSparked by the trademark wit, humor, and brilliant use of analogy that have made The ElegantUniverse a modern classic, Brian Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.\r\n\r\nWith 146 illustrations",

Endometriosis usually affects the mucous membrane of the uterus, but it can also be a traveler, with endometrial implants attaching themselves to the colon and the lungs. The tissue of the implants sheds, causing a monthly flow of blood that can lead to lung collapse. Desiring to call attention to the little-known disease, the author vibrantly recalls her 13-year struggle with the illness, the three major surgeries she underwent (in Army, Navy and Air Force hospitals) and the seven chest-tube procedures. She charts her progress and backslides, the expression of her symptoms and her close brushes with death. She also includes the surgeons\u2019 narrative summaries of her operations. During her protracted battle with the disease, she faced countless debilitating procedures, including colonic resections and an abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Though it may be expected that a military officer address each piece of new bad news with dignity and resolve, readers will still be impressed by Wallace\u2019s fortitude, as well as the thoughtful, caring impulse that prompted her to write this book: to alert other women to this obscure, diagnostic nightmare of an illness. \r\n\r\nA slim but sharp and valuable little book that will go a long way toward helping those who suffer from pulmonary endometriosis.",

If there\u2019s one thing Coach Brown knows, other than football, it\u2019s that college kids get into trouble. He also knows that if this book can help them stay out of trouble, it must be worth its weight in gold. According to a recent survey, over 55% of all college students will have some contact with law enforcement during their college careers. Most law abiding citizens are intimidated or panic when confronted by law enforcement. College students are no different, but they are much less prepared since they have had fewer experiences to draw from and are now thrust into the world of adult responsibility. Knowing how to deal with those situations can be invaluable and practical legal information is what they need. This book gives them the information in a humorous guide to help them avoid some of the common college pitfalls. This is an essential for every dorm room, apartment and fraternity/sorority house; always on hand to answer the simple legal questions that routinely come up on Texas\u2019 college campuses. Topics covered include parking tickets, apartment leases, drinking, credit cards, self-defense, parties and hazing, to name just a few. Most college students don\u2019t know what to do and especially what NOT to do in many situations. This book gives them the information to make smart choices. It should also give their parents a little peace of mind that they have armed their students with a weapon that can keep them on track and out of trouble.",

Here is an unparalleled opportunity to sit with a fully contemporary Western master and learn in the authentic Buddhist tradition -- through dialogue between teacher and student.\r\n\r\nJoko Beck's talks on such topics as Struggle, Sacrifice, Separation and Connection, Change, Awareness, Freedom, and Wonder reveal how authentic spirituality does not involve a special, separate life, but living in our everyday life -- feelings, relationships, work -- with awareness, honesty, and integrity. With her now legendary wit and penetrating insight, this celebrated teacher gives new richness to the idea of simplifying our lives. In the process, she reveals how when nothing is special, everything can be.",

From upscale eateries to the burgeoning roving food truck scenes in Los Angeles, New York, and elsewhere, authentic Mexican tacos--and tortas and tamales as well--are fast becoming some of America's favorite foods on the fly. And why wouldn't they? Versatile, handheld, and uncomplicated, tacos might be the perfect fast and delicious meal. Add the simple Mexican sandwiches called tortas and handmade tamales and you can fully experience the real everyday food of Mexico--easy to make and incredibly tasty. But if an authentic, south-of-the-border taco is out of reach, you can now recreate your own at home. One of the best things about real Mexican home cooking is that it's easier than you think. With simple preparations, delicious ingredients, and basic rules of thumb, you can make your favorites in the comfort of your own kitchen.  People from coast to coast are ditching fast food tacos and greasy Tex-Mex for real Mexican food at home--and this is the perfect cookbook for them  Roberto Santiba&ntilde;ez is the author of two other cookbooks, including Truly Mexican (Wiley), the owner of Fonda restaurant in Brooklyn, the former culinary director of Rosa Mexicano restaurants, the president of Truly Mexican Consulting in New York, and a member of The Culinary Institute of America's Latin Cuisines Advisory Council  In addition to tacos, tortas, and tamales, the book also includes recipes for fresh juices, smoothies, margaritas, and traditional Mexican sweets  Chef Santiba\u00f1ez's Tacos, Tortas, and Tamales will give you the simple guidance and authentic recipes to bring the true flavors of Mexico into your own kitchen\"--\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the title dishes, this book will also include recipes for juices, smoothies, margaritas, and simple Mexican sweets, all with approachable instructions and easy-to-find ingredients\"--",

            "description": "Today, on the Keys between Key West and the mainland, some 40,000 residents and thousands of visitors fish, swim, sail, and dive in the crystal clear waters off a tropical reef; relax in the sun and cooling trade wind breezes; and sleep in the air-conditioned comfort of their homes and hotel rooms.\r\n\r\nOn these same islands, as short a time as 80 years ago, fewer than 300 inhabitants tried to eke out a living without benefit of electricity, running water, radios, or telephones. Tormented by clouds of voracious mosquitoes and no-see-ums, broiled by the tropical sun, they lived in thatched-roof homes regularly flattened by hurricane winds. Weeks would go by before some passing sailboat brought them news of the outside world or their relatives.\r\n\r\nThe stories of these hardy pioneers and their predecessors, as far back as the Native Americans who lived on the Keys at least 1,000 years ago, are told, many for the first time, in this book. As vividly portrayed as if they were characters in a novel, these true-life inhabitants of the Florida Keys will capture your admiration as you share in the dreams and realities of their daily lives.\r\n\r\nThe Straits of Florida is a 110-mile sea passage between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean bordered on the northern side by the Florida Keys and the Florida Reef. In its waters, along the reef, and on desolate keys, thousands of men and women have died in shipwrecks, attacks by natives, sea battles, and pirate boardings. Few of their stories have survived, but those that have tell gripping tales of their struggles against the perils of the sea and the onslaughts of men. This book presents a selection of such stories during the age of sail from the time Spanish navigators discovered the Straits to the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842.\r\n\r\nExcerpted from ships' logs, captains' diaries, court-martial transcripts, and newspaper accounts, the stories in this volume\u2014a companion to The Florida Keys, Volume 1: A History of the Pioneers\u2014will make you glad you live in a modern world. Read harrowing tales of the cruelty and torture inflicted on mariners at the hands of bloodthirsty pirates; of pistol and cannon battles between merchant ships and wayward privateers; and of the hardships endured by some of Florida's earliest settlers.\r\n\r\nSprinkled with hand-drawn illustrations, photographs, and maps depicting the lay of the land during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this book presents a scholarly, historically accurate account of life on the Keys and in the perilous Straits of Florida during the age of sail. An index and extensive bibliography are included.\r\n\r\nIn this third book in a series on the history of the Florida Keys, John Viele tells the true story of the Florida Keys wreckers, the daring seamen who sailed out in fair weather or foul to save lives and property from ships cast up on the unforgiving Florida Reef. From the archives of the federal court at Key West, or \u201cwrecking court,\u201d and from contemporary letters, diaries, and newspaper articles, the author has captured the drama of the lives and times of the Florida Keys wreckers with accuracy and clarity.\r\n\r\nRichly illustrated with drawings from nineteenth-century magazines and newspapers, artists\u2019 concepts of wrecking scenes, and reproductions of old paintings and photographs, this book will fascinate sailors and landlubbers alike.\r\n\r\n- The evil crew of a wrecked Spanish slave ship hijacked their would-be rescuers and forced them to carry their wretched human cargo to Cuba.\r\n\r\n- Wreckers salvaged some strange cargoes\u2014an Egyptian mummy, the fossilized bones of a prehistoric sea monster, a railroad locomotive, and cavalry horses.\r\n\r\n- The crew of a small wrecking vessel barely escaped with their lives when they were attacked by a war party of Seminole Indians in dugout canoes.\r\n\r\n- Wrecking divers, working without benefit of any apparatus, plunged into the black, polluted waters of flooded cargo holds to wrestle out barrels, boxes, and 500-pound bales of cotton.",

Adler interviewed a colorful gallery of diverse people across the United States who believe that each person has a different path to divinity and that monotheism is a form of religious imperialism.  She attended many of their ritual gatherings and discovered, contrary to stereotypical images, that most neopagans have no gurus or masters, that their beliefs are nonauthoritarian in spirit, and that they find inspiration in ancient deities, nature, myth, even science fiction.  Still the only detailed history and comprehensive report on this little-known and largely misunderstood movement, Drawing Down the Moon has been revised and expanded to include new information on men's spirituality, Druids, Norse Paganism, and a complete guide of newsletters, journals, books, groups, and festivals.",

You attend Candlebury Junior High school during the weekdays, and Magia Sessions for Young Witches and Wizards on the weekends. With only two nights left to complete your assignment for Professor Whittlesworth on an extraordinary White Magic witch or wizard relative, you find yourself in a bind. You rack your brain as to where to look for the information needed, since the Spellbound Library had no records on any relatives for you to write about. You go up into the attic after your cat, (who is also a wizard) transforms himself into a wizard and hints for you to look in a place that is long ignored, dusty, and definitely not found in the living room. Upon searching the attic you find an old trunk with two journals belonging to a relative you just may be able to write about. Let us not forget to mention that your birthday campout is also coming up on the weekend, and while your two best mates stay over, you are led to a third secret just beyond the backyard in the eldest rings of wood. Meanwhile, the Dark Magic Sorceress who has a grudge against you and your family is rumored to be back from the dead seeking vengeance and you fear she has abducted your family. What would you do?\r\n\r\nAmber Shadows attempts to create and write about a fictional relative, having found no information on anyone in her family. Zapphorya, the family wizard cat who can vaporize into wizard form, hints to Amber that she should search the one place collecting dust and the like. Amber determines that he is referring to the dark attic, the same attic her brother and sister used to tell her harbored Dark Magical Monsters and Dark Magical Ghouls.  Reluctantly, she heads up into the attic and stumbles upon an antique trunk. She opens the trunk and finds two journals belonging to Jocelyn Shadows, her great-great grandmother. Amber secretly keeps the two journals with the belief that there is a connection between the whereabouts of her parents and grandparents (missing for nearly a year now), and the two mysterious, missing wands she\u2019s read about in the journals. What Amber stumbles upon during the night of her birthday campout, initiates the first of at least four quests in which she, and her two best friends face danger, learn the true meaning of friendship, and develop trust in each other\u2019s judgment when facing the notorious Sorceress Lady Gondara. Amber sets out alone until Marianna and Jasper join her on a quest to rescue her parents and grandparents while trying to survive the wrath of Lady Gondara. \r\n\r\nIt is somewhat a dark piece with a light of hope for the middle grade-young adult genre, a fantasy fiction with a hint of humor, suspenseful moments, and turmoil wrapped inside a fantastical world of magic, ghosts, and unusual beasts conjured up by Dark Magic. Readers will turn page after page as they experience a magical and dangerous adventure along with our White Magic Witch, Amber Shadows, as she takes on Lady Gondara, the most vengeful Dark Sorceress of the hidden Magian World. Will Amber, her two best mates, and her abducted family survive?\r\n\r\nCheck out Authorsden.com for a free, 10 chapter Sneak peek into this award winning book of the year.  Amber Shadows and the Missing Wands won the 2008 Spinetinglers Book of the Year Award, and Authorsandbooks.net Book of the Year Award in the young adult genre category.

The wife gets money from each of the people she helps. The well-designed illustration repeated at the beginning and end sums up the whole story.

Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.\r\n\r\nThis P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.\r\nSource: https://www.harpercollins.com/9780060837020/the-bell-jar/",

What happens is that lives, workplaces, cities and nations become transformed by the power of Jesus Christ. Called \"the next great movement of God,\" ministry in the workplace is like a sleeping giant that is starting to take the nation by storm.

            "description": "A growing body of readers is rediscovering Francis Graham Wilson\u2019s tremendous contribution to the study of politics and humane learning. In this volume he offers an extensive assessment of the nature of politics and the search for order in Spanish politics, concentrating on the central figures who defended the Church and communities during the Spanish Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe book argues for the uniqueness of Spain among the other countries of Europe. For Wilson, the most salutary attribute of Spanish politics is found in the assemblage of smaller groupings of the citizenry within the larger society in communities; and it is in the smaller association that the most important aspects of moral, social and political life were nurtured. Part 1 includes assessments of three eminent Spanish traditionalists, Juan Donoso Cort\u00e9s, Jaime Balmes, and Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, as well as studies of central figures from the period of the Spanish Civil War\u2014Jos\u00e9 Antonio and Ramiro de Maeztu. The final chapters are taken from an unpublished book-length manuscript, \u201cAn Anchor in the Latin Mind,\u201d that Wilson had completed at the time of his death in 1976, and was recently discovered by the editors. For Wilson, Latin thinkers possess advantages others do not\u2014a political realism that can be reinvigorated.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of Spanish traditionalism, according to this book, is dependent upon a return to the self-understanding of the ordering principles of Spanish politics and society. Wilson\u2019s affirmation of a Spanish traditionalist inheritance during his lifetime encouraged a return to authentic popular rule and a greater appreciation of Spanish achievements in politics and the moral life.\r\n\r\nH. Lee Cheek, Jr. is Chair of the Social and Behavioral Sciences Division and Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Brewton-Parker College in Mount Vernon, Georgia. His work has appeared in the Journal of Politics, International Social Science Review, and Methodist History. His other books include Calhoun and Popular Rule, Calhoun: Selected Writings and Speeches, and Political Philosophy and Cultural Renewal. M. Susan Power is Professor of Political Science at Arkansas State University. Her books include Before the Convention: Religion and the Founders and Jacques Maritain. Kathy B.

Told with a delicious sense of humor and a real insight to a kindergartener's mind, this children's book chronicles the adventures of Ramona's first few months at kindergarten. She spends her days pulling on the beautiful curly hair of the bossy Susan, chasing Davy around the playground for kisses, harassing the crossing guard Henry Huggins, making the \"Q\" in her name look like a cat, and seeking love and approval from her teacher, Miss Binney.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite her love for learning and kindergarten, school isn't as fair as Ramona would have hoped, which is why she finds herself hiding behind the school's trash cans in the cold, sitting on a bench while the rest of the class plays Grey Duck, being scolded by Miss Binney, and ultimately feeling as though she is unwanted in the classroom. What can Ramona do to prove that she's not a pest?",

It challenges readers to think of the consequences of extrapolating trends, such as Moore's Law, to either reach real machine intelligence or retrench in the face of physical limitations. From this perspective, the book draws \"the big picture\" for the Information Revolution's innovations in chips, devices, software, and networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Back Cover\r\n\r\n\"In their fascinating analysis of the recent history of information technology, H.
